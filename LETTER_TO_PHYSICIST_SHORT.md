# Division Algebra Framework: 1-Page Summary

**Claim**: Three formulas match fundamental constants to sub-ppm precision using only division algebra dimensions {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11}.

## The Three Statistically Significant Results

| Constant | Formula | Error |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **1/α** | 137 + 4/111 = 15211/111 | **0.27 ppm** |
| **m_p/m_e** | 1836 + 11/72 = 132203/72 | **0.06 ppm** |
| **cos(θ_W)** | 171/194 | **3.75 ppm** |

**Where the numbers come from**:
- 4 = dim(H) = quaternion dimension = spacetime
- 11 = dim(R) + dim(C) + dim(O) = 1 + 2 + 8 = "crystal" dimensions
- 137 = 4² + 11² (unique prime of this form)
- 111, 72, 194 claimed from Lie algebra structure

## Why This Might Be Real

- Sub-ppm precision from integers alone is unlikely by chance
- Same structural numbers (73, 111, etc.) appear across multiple constants
- Division algebra dimensions are mathematically forced (Frobenius/Hurwitz)

## Why This Might Be Numerology

- Framework can match 100% of random numbers at 1-5% precision
- Only 3 of 46 claimed results are at significant precision
- Similar approaches have failed before
- Post-hoc fitting: formulas found after knowing answers

## One Testable Prediction

**Dark Matter Mass = 5.11 GeV** (m_p × 49/9)

Experiments: SuperCDMS, LZ, NEWS-G (2026-2027)

Falsification: WIMP detected at mass NOT in 4.5-5.7 GeV range

## The Question

Are the 3 sub-ppm matches related (real structure) or coincidental?

- If related: worth understanding
- If coincidental: sophisticated numerology

**I don't know which. Can you help determine this?**
