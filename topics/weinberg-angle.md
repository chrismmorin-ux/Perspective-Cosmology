# Topic: Weinberg Angle

**Current state**: sin²θ_W = 28/121, α₃/α₂ = 7/2 at 0.34%. **Derivation chain FULLY COMPLETE** (S292: spectral convergence resolved via C5 + IRA-10). Steps 1-5 [THEOREM/DERIVATION], Step 6 fully decomposed: full compositeness [D from axioms] + WSR theorem [I-QFT] + spectral convergence [DERIVED from finiteness, S292]. Quartic potential alone insufficient (dim-2 condensate in V-A OPE). IRA-02 eliminated, IRA count 9->8. WSR explain democratic vs Dynkin: non-perturbative reshuffling, factor n_d=4. RG tension real (15:1) but BSM deficit only 0.36%. κ=1 subordinate. EQ-007/EQ-022/EQ-004/EQ-020 all RESOLVED.

## What Works

- **sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121 = 0.23140** — matches MS-bar at M_Z to 843 ppm (S151, S154)
- **28 = N_Goldstone(SO(11)->SO(4)xSO(7))** — structural origin proven (S154)
- **cos(theta_W) = 171/194** — matches on-shell definition to ~93 ppm (Band A, CORRECTED S283 from S279's Band B claim)
- **Two-scheme consistency**: MS-bar vs on-shell scheme difference agrees to 2.4% (S154)
- **Uniqueness**: 28/121 is unique among ALL framework ratios in search space (S154)
- **RG scale**: 28/121 matches SM running at mu = 94.6 GeV, near M_Z (S155)
- **x(1-x) form**: sin^2 = (n_d/n_c)(1-n_d/n_c) = Bernoulli variance with p=4/11 (S154)
- **7% discrepancy RESOLVED**: 1/α₂ = (28/121) × 127.955 = 29.61, 0.07% from measured (S160)
- **Scheme identification**: 28/121 between MS-bar (800 ppm) and LEP effective (540 ppm) (S160)
- **O = dim(SU(3)) structural**: via G2 = Aut(O) fixing complex direction (S160)
- **α₃/α₂ = n_d×Im_O/dim(O) = 7/2 = 3.500** — matches measured 3.488 to 0.34%, zero free parameters (S218)
- **T_SU2 = T_SU3 = 22** — structural theorem: both gauge groups have identical Dynkin indices in End(V). Follows from T(fund SO(4) under SU(2)) = T(fund G₂ under SU(3)) = 1. Proves one-loop gives wrong answer. (S218)
- **T_fund = 1 from division algebra minimality** [DERIVATION] — dim(H)=4 = 2×dim_ℂ(fund SU(2)), dim(Im_O)=7 = 1+2×dim_ℂ(fund SU(3)). Each hosts exactly ONE conjugate pair of gauge fundamental with zero excess dimensions. Frobenius guarantees no intermediate sizes. Non-division-algebra dims give T≠1. (S222)
- **Singlet criterion for two regimes** [CONJECTURE] — R⁴ has 0 SU(2)_L singlets (interface → N=28 coset), R⁷ has 1 SU(3) singlet (internal → N=8 group dim). Singlet exists because G₂→SU(3) requires choosing i∈Im_O, creating invariant direction. SU(2) needs no choice (SO(4)=SU(2)² canonical). Root cause: H associative vs O non-associative. (S222)
- **Democratic counting from Schur's lemma** [DERIVATION] — Tangent space Hom(R⁴,R⁷) ≅ R⁴⊗R⁷ is IRREDUCIBLE under isotropy group SO(4)×SO(7). By Schur's lemma, the HS metric (AXM_0110) restricted to this space is the unique invariant bilinear form: (1/n_c)×I₂₈. All 28 directions metrically equal. Dynkin weighting excluded (single irreducible component → one scale factor). Same for SU(3): adjoint irreducible (simple Lie algebra) → Killing form democratic. 1/α_EM(tree) = n_c² = 121. RG correction factors ~5.7% for all three couplings (spread 0.34%). Gap narrowed to [A-PHYSICAL]: emergent gauge field inherits metric. (S224)
- **Step 6 [A-PHYSICAL] is irreducible** [FINDING] — Three geometric mechanisms on Gr(4,11) give three distinct gauge couplings: democratic N=28 (metric-level, Schur), Dynkin T=7 (one-loop perturbative), curvature C_L=21=Im_O×Im_H (curvature projection onto SU(2)_L). Democratic/Dynkin = n_d = 4 exactly. Measurement selects democratic (0.34%) over Dynkin (71.3%) and curvature (25%). Cannot be derived from AXM_0109/0110/0117. (S228)
- **RG tension quantified** [DERIVATION] — SM-only running: Λ₂=2115 GeV, Λ₃=141 GeV, ratio 15:1. Compositeness scale f=1354 GeV between them. Colored pNGBs (24 modes) make tension WORSE (ratio→22-34). Required BSM correction only 0.36%. Framework expression Im_H/(n_d·n_c+n_h)=1/17≈5.88% near ε_avg=5.81%. (S228)
- **κ=1 subordinate to Step 6** [ANALYSIS] — Canonical normalization of Goldstone fields gives κ=1 when Step 6 accepted. 1/n_c from HS metric cancels with n_c from trace normalization. Not a separate assumption. (S228)
- **WSR conditional derivation of I-STRUCT-5** [DERIVATION + I-QFT] — Full compositeness from axioms (no elementary gauge fields in AXM_0109-0117) + Weinberg sum rules (standard QFT) + Schur's lemma → 1/g² = democratic metric. **Spectral convergence RESOLVED (S292)**: C5 (finiteness) + IRA-10 -> finite Hilbert space -> WSR converge. Quartic potential alone insufficient (dim-2 condensate in V-A OPE gives rho ~ 1/s). WSR explain perturbative/non-perturbative distinction: Dynkin T=7 → democratic N=28, reshuffling factor = n_d = 4. (S238/S292)
- **One-loop dressed value** [CONJECTURE] — sin^2(dressed) = 28/121 - alpha/(4*pi^2) = 0.23122, 0.00 sigma from measured. C_W = 1/(4*pi) in alpha/pi basis. 4*pi^2 = n_d*pi^2 = (16*pi^2)/n_d. T_3 trace analog gives 6/11 (does NOT match — extra 1/(4*pi) suppression needed, origin OPEN). 24/24 PASS. (S276)
- **Coefficient n_d = dim(H)** [CONJECTURE] — In alpha/(16*pi^2) basis, coefficient = n_d = 4. Structural origin: 28 coset modes = R^4 x R^7, mixing scans R^4 = H factor, n_d directions contribute equally (SO(4) isotropy). Resolves T_3 negative result: mixing angles have geometric coefficients, couplings have algebraic coefficients. n_d unique within 1 sigma (n=3,5 at ~1.7 sigma). 18/21 PASS. (S279)
- **m_p/m_e Band C coefficient = 43/7 = Phi_6(Im_O)/Im_O** [CONJECTURE, HRS 4] — Absolute basis: delta(m_p/m_e) = C * alpha^2/pi. Extracted C = 6.156, 43/7 = 6.143 (0.22% match, 949 sigma significance). Dressed m_p/m_e = 1836.15267365 (2.0 sigma residual). Cyclotomic: Phi_6(7) = 43. Supersedes earlier relative-basis 1/297 (0.43%). 20/20 PASS. (S282)
- **Systematic 16-ratio band classification** [DERIVATION] — All ratios classified: Band C (3): m_p/m_e, v/M_Koide, 1/alpha. Band B (4): v/m_p, m_mu/m_e, Koide_theta, m_c/m_s. Band A (7): m_tau/m_mu through sin^2. Band D: quark ratios + CKM. 35/36 PASS. (S282)
- **Band A new coefficients** [SPECULATION] — alpha_s: C = 1/n_c in alpha/pi (1.4%, 0.02 sigma). m_tau/m_mu: C = 1/33 = 1/(Im_H*n_c) in alpha/pi (0.15%, 0.8 sigma). Testable predictions. (S282)
- **Double-trace pattern** [SPECULATION] — Alpha: C = (12/n_c)*2. m_p/m_e: C = (43/n_c)*(n_c/7). Both have n_c in first factor denominator. (S282)
- **Coefficient physics-type taxonomy** [CONJECTURE] — Mixing->geometric (n_d), EM coupling->trace (24/11), QCD mass->cyclotomic (43/7), lepton mass->inverse (1/n_d, 1/33), QCD coupling->crystal (1/n_c). (S282)
- **Double-trace mechanism** [CONJECTURE] — Band C specific: End(V) trace normalization by n_c in first factor. All 8 coefficients are framework monomials. n_c cancels in m_p/m_e -> pure octonionic. Deep identity: Phi_6(Im_H) = Im_O. (S283)
- **cos(theta_W) Band A correction** [CORRECTION] — S279 Band B claim RETRACTED. Gap ~93 ppm is Band A. Tree-level sin^2+cos^2 = 1.008 (mismatch -8347 ppm). No clean coefficient found. (S283)
- **m_p/m_e C_3 negative result** — C_3~5.7 extracted, no clean framework match. 2.0 sigma not significant. (S283)
- **sin^2+cos^2 mismatch = scheme conversion** [DERIVATION] — sin^2=28/121 is MS-bar, cos=171/194 is on-shell. Different schemes, so sin^2+cos^2 != 1 expected. Framework Delta = 0.00835 vs experimental Delta = 0.00802 (4.1% match). sqrt(93)/11 is 57x WORSE than 171/194. 16/17 PASS. (S307)
- **m_tau/m_mu dressed prediction** [SPECULATION] — C=1/(Im_H*n_c)=1/33 in alpha/pi basis. Tree 185/11 (70 ppm gap) -> dressed 16.8170 (1.9 ppm, 37x improvement). Testable at Belle II ~2027 (need 23 ppm). 20/20 PASS. (S307)
- **alpha_s dressed prediction** [SPECULATION] — C=1/n_c=1/11 in alpha/pi basis. Tree 25/212 (208 ppm gap) -> dressed 0.11790 (3 ppm). Not constraining with current uncertainty. (S307)
- **cos(theta_W) coefficient candidate C=dim(C)=2** [SPECULATION] — In alpha/(16*pi^2) basis gives 0.88 ppm residual (Band C level). Extracted C=2.02, match to dim(C) 0.95%. Same dim(C) in alpha's 24/11=12/11*2. Needs m_W to ~1 MeV for meaningful test. (S307)
- **Band structure = organizing principle** [CONJECTURE] — Band C: multi-factor trace-normalized coefficients. Band B/A: single-monomial suppression factors. Absolute corrections need trace structure; relative corrections need suppression factors. Sector-dominance maps physics type to algebraic structure. (S307)
- **Band membership predicted a priori** [CONJECTURE] — 3-step structural criterion: (1) QCD-dominant -> Band D, (2) EM one-loop -> Band A, (3) trace-enhanced C>1 -> Band C, suppression C<1 -> Band B. 16/16 correct. Key: compositeness + End(V) trace = Band C signature. (S308)
- **Three EM scales from structural reasons** [CONJECTURE] — 2 loop orders x coefficient dichotomy (C>1 vs C<1) = 3 non-empty cells. C=1 natural B/C boundary (Koide sits exactly there). A/B gap set by 1/alpha (~137x), B/C gap by coefficient ratio (~10-70x). Clean separations. (S308)
- **Band D = feature** [CONJECTURE] — All Band D gaps < alpha_s/pi (~37500 ppm). QCD-dominated quantities correctly predicted outside perturbative EM dressing scope. (S308)
- **Phi_6 cascade mirrors band depth** [DERIVATION/OBSERVATION] — Phi_6: 2->3->7->43->111 maps to Cayley-Dickson tower AND band-defining denominators. 43 in Band B, 111 in Band C. Cascade depth correlates with precision. (S308)
- **121-28-137 triangle** [DERIVATION] — 121=End(V) in Band A denom, 28=coset in Band A numer, 137~alpha in Band C. Sum 121+137=258 in Band D. Mathematical depth -> prediction precision. (S308)
- **Mathematical depth -> precision hierarchy** [SPECULATION] — Quadratic forms -> sub-ppm. Cyclotomic -> ppm. Linear products -> 100 ppm. Additive -> percent. (S308)
- **Phi_6 cascade = Sylvester's sequence** [DERIVATION] — Phi_6(x) = x^2-x+1 from dim(C)=2 generates {2,3,7,43,1807,...} = Sylvester's sequence (product formula verified). Connection is exact. (S309)
- **Egyptian fraction of unity** [THEOREM] — 1/dim_C + 1/Im_H + 1/Im_O + 1/43 + ... = 1. Physical terms give 41/42, remainder = 1/42 = 1/(dim_C*Im_H*Im_O). Division algebra cascade values partition unity. (S309)
- **Band exclusivity of cascade denominators** [CONJECTURE] — Pure Phi_6 cascade values as full denominators: {3,7}->D, {43}->B, {111}->C, {1807+}->absent. Gap gradient: 1500->2.8->0.27 ppm. Deeper cascade -> finer band. (S309)
- **Physics termination at cascade depth** [OBSERVATION] — 1807=13*139 and 12211 (prime) appear nowhere in framework: not as denominators, numerators, or factors. Physics extends ONE Phi_6 step beyond Hurwitz, then stops. (S309)
- **Cyclotomic D=3 exclusively maps to B/C** [CONJECTURE] — All denominators that are Phi_6 evaluations of atoms appear only in Band B or C. 100% purity. General depth D(den) alone does NOT anti-correlate (rho=+0.34), but total D(num)+D(den) weakly does (rho=-0.37). (S309)
- **Beta function ladder** [OBSERVATION] — b_0(N_f=0)=n_c=11, b_0(N_f=3)=Im_H^2=9, b_0(N_f=6)=Im_O=7. QCD beta coefficients at natural flavor counts equal division algebra numbers. **DEBUNKED (S310)**: just odd numbers 11->1, repackaging of 11/3=n_c/Im_H (EQ-008). Only b_0(0)=n_c and b_0(6)=Im_O structural. (S309/S310)
- **Egyptian fraction numerators = Lie algebra dimensions** [DERIVATION] — Over LCM denominator 42=dim_C*Im_H*Im_O, numerators are: 42/2=21=dim(so(7)), 42/3=14=dim(G_2), 42/7=6=dim(so(4)). Cross-algebraic pattern: C->SO(7), H->G_2, O->SO(4). Follows from Cayley-Dickson Im_H=(Im_O-1)/2 and dim(G_2)=2*Im_O. 42=dim_R(so(7)_C). (S310)
- **Sylvester-CD branching at Im_H** [DERIVATION] — Phi_6(x)=2x+1 has unique solution x=3=Im_H. H is the branching point where local (CD doubling) and global (Sylvester product) diverge. Beyond this: CD gives 15 (sedenions, zero divisors), Sylvester gives 43 (framework physics). 43-15=28=N_Goldstone=n_d*Im_O [DERIVATION]. (S310)
- **Phi_6(n) = n(n-1)+1 = off-diagonal endomorphisms + 1** [THEOREM] — Connects to Egyptian fraction: Phi_6(Im_O)-1 = 7*6 = 42 = Egyptian denominator (same object). (S310)
- **Graded decomposition 42 = 21+14+6+1** [DERIVATION] — Construction sequence R->Im(O)->Lambda^2(Im(O))->Lambda^2(Im(O))_C with cumulative dims {1,7,21,42} and ratios {Im_O=7, Im_H=3, dim_C=2} = Sylvester denominators in reverse Cayley-Dickson order. Sequence is UNIQUE: exterior algebra C(7,k)/C(7,k-1) integer only at k=1,2 (giving {7,3}), forcing switch to complexification. Layer sizes = Lie algebra dims in chain so(4) subset G_2 subset SO(7). (S311)
- **Coset dimensions = division algebra dimensions** [THEOREM] — SO(7)/G_2 = 7 = Im_O, G_2/SO(4) = 8 = dim_O. Coset spaces are literally octonionic. Cumulative/Quotient = 42/21 = dim_C = 2 (the complexification step). (S311)
- **Ratio-minus-one = Cayley-Dickson dimensions** [THEOREM] — Im_O-1=6=C(n_d,2)=dim(so(4)), Im_H-1=2=dim_C, dim_C-1=1=Im_C. Layer formula: Layer_k = F_{k-1}*(ratio_k - 1). (S311)
- **Weight distribution** [DERIVATION] — so(7) gets 1/2=1/dim_C of budget, G_2 gets 1/3=1/Im_H, so(4) gets 1/7=1/Im_O. Anti-correlation: simplest algebra (C, weight 1/2) funds largest group (SO(7), 21 dim). (S311)
- **42 + 28 = C(dim_O, n_d) = C(8,4) = 70** [DERIVATION] — Chain sum + Goldstones = 4th exterior power of O. N_Goldstone = C(dim_O, 2) via dim_O = 2*n_d (CD doubling). Also: 70 = Im_O*(n_c-1). (S312)
- **55 - 42 = Phi_6(n_d) = 13** [DERIVATION] — so(n_c) deficit = cyclotomic at n_d. Identity n_d^2-n_d+2 = 2*Im_O holds ONLY at n_d=1,4 [THEOREM] (roots of (n-1)(n-4)=0). (S312)
- **G_2/SO(4) Wolf space** [THEOREM] — dim=8=dim_O, chi=3=Im_H (|W(G_2)|/|W(SO(4))|=12/4), quat_dim=2=dim_C. ALL three invariants are division algebra dimensions. Parameterizes quaternionic subalgebras H inside O. Poincare polynomial 1+t^4+t^8. (S312)
- **F_4/(Sp(3)*Sp(1)) Wolf space** [OBSERVATION] — dim=28=N_Goldstone, chi=7=Im_O, quat_dim=7=Im_O. Two of five exceptional Wolf spaces have BOTH invariants as framework numbers; the other three (E_6, E_7, E_8) do not. (S312)
- **SO(4) content of 42: integer/half-integer split** [DERIVATION] — Integer spin = 22 = 2*n_c. Half-integer = 20 = chi(Gr+(4,11)). L-R asymmetry = Im_H. Split SPECIFIC to Im_H=3 [THEOREM]: 2h^2-5h-3=0 has unique positive root h=3. (S312)
- **Branching rules verified** [THEOREM] — 7->(1/2,1/2)+(0,1)=4+3 (octonionic decomp). 14->(1,0)+(0,1)+2*(1/2,1/2)=6+8 (Cartan decomp). so(7)->(1,0)+2*(0,1)+(1/2,1/2)+(1/2,3/2)=21 (Lambda^2). (S312)
- **Fork Gap Theorem** [DERIVATION] — dim(so(11))-dim(F_4) = Im_H = 3. Fork at so(9) not so(7): both contain so(9)=so(dim_O+1)=so(Im_H^2). so(11) extends classically (so(2)+R^9xR^2=19 gen), F_4 extends spinorially (Delta_9=2^n_d=16 gen). Gap = 19-16 = 3 because n_d^2 = 2^n_d (triple identity, unique at n_d=4). Gap decomposes as Im_C+dim_C=1+2=Im_H (Cayley-Dickson C->H). (S313)
- **F_4 incompatible with SO(11)** [DERIVATION] — Different ranks (4 vs 5), different extensions of SO(7). F_4=Aut(J_3(O)) (octonionic); SO(11)=Isom(R^n_c) (crystallization). dim(F_4)=n_d*Phi_6(n_d)=52=C(n_c,2)-Im_H. The dim=28 match is structural: 4*quat_dim vs n_d*Im_O, both=28 because quat_dim=Im_O and n_d=4. (S313)
- **Chi sequence terminates** [DERIVATION] — G_2 Wolf chi=Im_H=3, F_4 Wolf chi=Im_O=7. No Wolf space has chi=n_c=11 (not exceptional, not Gr_4^+). HP^10 has chi=11 but dim=40 (not framework). Termination forced by Hurwitz (no post-octonionic division algebra). Chi product=21=dim(so(7)), chi sum=10=n_c-1. Wolf dim sum=36=C(9,2)=dim(so(9)). (S313)
- **n^2=2^n solutions = {dim_C, n_d} = {2, 4}** [THEOREM] — Both framework dimensions satisfy the triple identity. Connects fork gap to division algebra tower. (S313)

## What Failed / Dead Ends

- **Running reconciliation**: sin^2 INCREASES with energy. Both 28/121 and 29/126 are EW-scale predictions, not related by running. (S155 — FALSIFIED)
- **Correction term search**: No clean framework correction to 28/121 found. -n_d/(n_c^2*Phi_6) gives 445 ppm (worse). (S154)
- **29/126 from induced mechanism**: Alternative formula from charge-weighted sums. Slightly worse precision (0.45% vs 843 ppm). (S153)
- **Standard one-loop derivation of democratic counting**: Dynkin indices give T_L=T_R=15 → sin²=1/2 or 3/8, NOT democratic. Cannot derive 1/g_i² ~ N_i from perturbative QFT. (S160 — NEGATIVE RESULT). **Upgraded S218**: T_SU2 = T_SU3 = 22 exactly → one-loop predicts α₂ = α₃ (wrong by 3.5×). Perturbative approach is provably wrong.
- **Democratic counting for SU(3)**: N_SU3_charged = 94 modes in End(V) gives α₃/α₂ = 28/94 = 0.298, WRONG DIRECTION (predicts α₃ < α₂). Naive democratic extension falsified. Only N=8=dim(SU(3)) works. (S218 — NEGATIVE RESULT)
- **HS metric argument**: The HS inner product from AXM_0110 is a universal rescaling (all modes get factor 1/n_c). Cannot change coupling RATIOS like sin²θ_W. The one-loop commutator [A_μ,M] introduces Dynkin-index weighting regardless of scalar field metric. (S215 — DEAD END)
- **Coset geometry alone**: dim(coset)/dim(SO(11)) = 28/55 ≠ sin²θ_W. The denominator must be dim(End(V)) = 121, not dim(SO(11)) = 55. Coset provides numerator but needs eval map for denominator. (S215 — PARTIAL)

## Open Paths

1. ~~**Task B — Derive S_2=29**~~ **DONE (S159)**: Complex Bridge principle gives S_2 = H_pure + CH_cross + CO_cross = 9 + 6 + 14 = 29.
2. ~~**Task D — Correction terms**~~ **DONE (S159)**: Corrections exist but NOT analogous to 4/111 (HRS=5).
3. ~~**Task E — GUT trace**~~ **DONE (S158)**: Gives 1/2 or 3/8, never 28/121.
4. ~~**Democratic counting mechanism**~~ **RESOLVED (S224/S228)**: Schur's lemma [DERIVATION] (S224) + Step 6 [A-PHYSICAL] irreducible (S228). Three mechanisms give 28/7/21 — only democratic matches. Gap = one physical assumption.
5. ~~**Two-regime mechanism**~~ **RESOLVED (S222)**: Singlet criterion — 0 singlets → interface, 1 singlet → internal. Combined with Schur's lemma (S224) gives full derivation chain (contingent on Step 6 [A-PHYSICAL]).
6. ~~**SU(3) mode counting test**~~ **DONE (S218)**: N_SU3_charged = 94 FAILS. Only dim(SU(3)) = 8 works. Structural theorem T_SU2 = T_SU3 = 22 discovered. Two-regime confirmed.
7. ~~**T_fund = 1 deeper meaning**~~ **DONE (S222)**: Division algebra minimality, NOT coincidence. dim(H) and dim(Im_O) are exactly the right sizes to host one conjugate pair. Frobenius + branching rules force T=1.
8. ~~**Emergent gauge coupling formalization**~~ **RESOLVED as irreducible (S228)**: Step 6 cannot be derived from AXM_0109/0110/0117. Recommend adopting as falsifiable framework principle.
9. ~~**RG matching tension**~~ **QUANTIFIED (S228)**: 15:1 scale ratio. Colored pNGBs worsen it. Required BSM = 0.36%. Full composite sector calculation needed.
10. ~~**κ=1 normalization**~~ **RESOLVED as subordinate (S228)**: Follows from Step 6 + canonical normalization. Not independent.

| S233 | Step 6 adoption + deeper derivation | **I-STRUCT-5 adopted** [A-PHYSICAL]. EQ-007/004/020/022 resolved. RG: top partners/pNGBs worsen; deficit (~α_s/(4π)) natural. 4 derivation candidates: full compositeness (Weinberg SRs) best. 2 scripts, 27/27 PASS. |
| S238 | WSR from crystallization dynamics | **Conditional theorem**: full compositeness [D] + WSR [I-QFT] + Schur [D] → I-STRUCT-5. Gap narrows: [A-PHYSICAL] → [CONJECTURE: C3 spectral convergence]. WSR explain democratic/Dynkin reshuffling (factor n_d=4). 1 script, 21/21 PASS. |
| S276 | One-loop coefficient structure | **sin^2(dressed) = 28/121 - alpha/(4*pi^2)** [CONJECTURE]. 0.00 sigma. C_W = 1/(4*pi). T_3 analog NEGATIVE (6/11 != 1/(4*pi)). 24/24 PASS. |
| S279 | Coefficient structural origin + Band B | **Coefficient = n_d = dim(H)** [CONJECTURE]. Hom(R^4,R^7) mixing scans R^4. Resolves T_3 negative. Band B: m_mu/m_e ~ 1/n_d (4%), v/m_p ~ 1/n_c (0.1%) [SPECULATION]. 30/37 PASS. |
| S282 | Tree-to-dressed: systematic + m_p/m_e | **m_p/m_e: C=43/7=Phi_6(Im_O)/Im_O** [CONJECTURE] (0.22%, absolute basis). 16-ratio band classification. Double-trace pattern. Coefficient taxonomy. 35/36 PASS (2 scripts). |
| S283 | Double-trace + cos(theta_W) + 3-loop | Double-trace Band C specific (21/21 PASS). cos(theta_W) CORRECTED to Band A (17/17 PASS). C_3 negative result (17/17 PASS). |
| S292 | CONJ-A1 spectral convergence | **CONJ-A1 RESOLVED**: quartic alone insufficient (dim-2 condensate), finiteness (C5+IRA-10) resolves. IRA-02 eliminated. IRA 9->8. 24/24 PASS. |
| S307 | EQ-039 coefficient unification + Band A | sin^2+cos^2 mismatch = scheme conversion [DERIVATION] (16/17 PASS). Band A dressed: m_tau/m_mu 1.9 ppm, alpha_s 3 ppm [SPECULATION] (20/20 PASS). cos coefficient C=dim(C)=2 candidate [SPECULATION]. Band structure = organizing principle [CONJECTURE]. |
| S308 | Band structure deep dive | Band membership predicted a priori (16/16, 3-step criterion) [CONJECTURE]. 3 EM scales from 2 loop orders x coefficient dichotomy [CONJECTURE]. Band D = feature (QCD-dominant) [CONJECTURE]. Phi_6 cascade mirrors band depth. 121-28-137 triangle. 25/25 PASS (1 script). |
| S309 | Phi_6 cascade formalization + depth measure | **Phi_6 = Sylvester's sequence** [DERIVATION]. **Egyptian fraction: 1/2+1/3+1/7+...=1** [THEOREM]. Band exclusivity [CONJECTURE]. Physics termination (1807 absent) [OBSERVATION]. D(den) alone fails (rho=+0.34), but D=3 -> B/C exclusively. Beta ladder b_0={11,9,7}. 72/75 PASS (3 scripts). |
| S310 | Egyptian fraction interpretation + Sylvester-CD | **Numerators = Lie algebra dims** [DERIVATION]: 21=so(7), 14=G_2, 6=so(4). Cross-algebraic pattern. Beta ladder DEBUNKED. **Sylvester-CD branching at Im_H** [DERIVATION]. **43-15=28=N_Goldstone**. Phi_6(n)=n(n-1)+1 [THEOREM]. 64/64 PASS (3 scripts). |
| S311 | Graded decomposition 42=21+14+6+1 | **Construction sequence** R->Im(O)->Lambda^2->Lambda^2_C with ratios {7,3,2} = reverse CD [DERIVATION]. Exterior algebra forces switch. **Coset dims = div alg dims** [THEOREM]: SO(7)/G_2=7, G_2/SO(4)=8. Cumulative/Quotient=dim_C [THEOREM]. 32/32 PASS (1 script). |
| S312 | G_2/SO(4) Wolf space + structural identities | **G_2/SO(4)**: dim=dim_O, chi=Im_H, qd=dim_C [THEOREM]. **F_4 Wolf**: dim=28, chi=7 [OBSERVATION]. SO(4) split: int=2n_c, half=chi(Gr+), unique to Im_H=3 [THEOREM]. 42+28=C(8,4), 55-42=Phi_6(n_d). 59/59 PASS (2 scripts). |
| S313 | Wolf space fork: F_4 role + fork gap theorem | **Fork Gap Theorem**: dim(so(11))-dim(F_4)=Im_H [DERIVATION] via n_d^2=2^n_d. Fork at so(9) not so(7): classical (19 gen) vs spinorial (16 gen). Gap=Im_C+dim_C=1+2 (CD C->H). Chi {3,7} terminates by Hurwitz. dim(F_4)=n_d*Phi_6(n_d). n^2=2^n solutions={dim_C, n_d}. 53/53 PASS (2 scripts). |
