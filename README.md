# Perspective Cosmology

**Claim**: Physics is the unique mathematical structure compatible with observation itself.

**Status**: Speculative framework with testable predictions
**Warning**: Amateur theoretical physics. Not peer-reviewed. AI-assisted development.

## Key Results

From the requirement that observation be consistent (no zero-divisors):

| Derived | Formula/Value | Precision |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Fine structure | 1/α = 137 + 4/111 | 0.27 ppm |
| Proton-electron ratio | m_p/m_e = 1836 + 11/72 | 0.06 ppm |
| Weinberg angle | cos(θ_W) = 171/194 | 3.75 ppm |
| Hubble constant | H₀ = 337/5 | EXACT |
| Dark energy | Ω_Λ = 137/200 | EXACT |
| Matter density | Ω_m = 63/200 | EXACT |
| Gauge group | U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) | DERIVED |
| Spacetime | 3+1 dimensions | DERIVED |
| Fermions | 15 per generation | DERIVED |
| Gravity | Einstein equations | DERIVED |

**All from {1, 2, 4, 8}** — the division algebra dimensions.

## The Decisive Test

**Dark matter mass: m_DM = 5.11 GeV**

- Derived from cosmological ratios AND fourth-generation structure
- Testable NOW: SuperCDMS (2026), LZ (ongoing)
- If found at 4.5-5.7 GeV: strong support
- If found elsewhere: **framework falsified**

See `predictions/dark_matter_5gev.md` for full derivation.

*We propose that comprehensibility is not surprising — it is necessary.*
