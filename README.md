# Perspective Cosmology

A speculative mathematical framework exploring whether perspective-based axioms can generate useful models for physics.

**Status**: Active development / Research project
**Warning**: This is amateur theoretical physics. Not peer-reviewed.

## Epistemological Stance

- This is exploratory mathematics, not established physics
- All claims have explicit confidence levels
- Computational verification required for numerical claims
- See `CLAUDE.md` for full methodology
