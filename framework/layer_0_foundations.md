# Layer 0: Foundational Questions

**Status**: ACTIVE — Open ontological questions
**Purpose**: Document the deepest assumptions and unresolved origin questions

## 1. Ontological Ordering

### The Question
What is fundamental, and what emerges?

### Current Working Model

```
FUNDAMENTAL (primitive)
    │
    ▼
  Perspective
    │
    ▼
  Dimensional structure (B) — "scars" from symmetry breaking
    │
    ▼
  Points (P) — where dimensions overlap
    │
    ▼
  Content, connectivity, etc.
```

### Key Insight (2026-01-26)

**Points are not fundamental.**

Points emerge as intersections of dimensional structure. A "point" is where multiple basis directions have non-trivial mutual content.

```
p ↔ S ⊆ B   where S = {bᵢ : content projects onto bᵢ}
```

**Dimensions may not be fundamental either.**

Dimensions might emerge from perspective-breaking-symmetry. Each nucleation of perspective creates an asymmetry; that asymmetry defines a direction; that direction IS a dimension.

### Implication

The "perfect crystal" outside has no internal dimensions we would recognize — it's undifferentiated symmetry. Our dimensions are the scar pattern left by perspective.

## 2. Origin of Perspective

### The Core Question

How does perspective itself come into existence?

### Candidate Mechanisms

#### 2.1 External Cause ("God-like touch")
- Something outside the perfect crystal introduces the first perspective
- **Problem**: What is "outside" an infinite perfect structure?
- **Where it might appear later**: If we need individual perturbations from outside the structure onto the structure after it exists

#### 2.2 Entropic Inevitability
- Infinite extent + infinite duration → any improbable event has probability 1
- Somewhere, somewhen, a fluctuation occurs
- That fluctuation IS the first perspective
- **Problem**: What is "time" before perspective exists? Fluctuation requires a medium.

#### 2.3 Self-Reference Instability
- A structure rich enough to represent itself must be incomplete (Gödel)
- The representation-of-the-whole cannot be the whole
- This incompleteness IS the first perspective
- **Implication**: Perspective was always implicit in sufficiently rich structure
- **Status**: Philosophically appealing, needs formalization

#### 2.4 Symmetry Instability
- Perfect symmetry is unstable (balanced pencil)
- The crystal MUST break somewhere — spontaneous symmetry breaking
- No cause needed; it's the lowest-energy configuration
- **Physics parallel**: Higgs mechanism, vacuum phase transitions

#### 2.5 Nothing Cannot Exist
- A perfect undifferentiated crystal is indistinguishable from nothing
- "Nothing" is self-contradictory (there exists a thing that is nothing)
- Therefore differentiation must exist
- Perspective is the minimal differentiation
- **Implication**: Perspective is necessary for the crystal to BE anything

### Working Hypothesis

**Perspective may be necessary rather than caused.**

The crystal doesn't "become" perspective-containing through some event. Rather, perspective-containing is the only coherent form of the structure. The "perfect crystal" is an abstraction that can't actually exist undifferentiated.

### Open Questions

1. Can we formalize "self-reference necessitates perspective"?
2. Is there a mathematical structure where "too much symmetry" is provably unstable?
3. What distinguishes the first nucleation from subsequent ones?

---

## 3. Nucleation Scenarios

### 3.1 Single Nucleation (Big Bang)
- One original symmetry break
- All subsequent structure is internal to that break
- Dimensions fixed at nucleation
- Our universe is a single defect region

### 3.2 Ongoing Nucleation (Cosmic Growth)
- New perspective instances can nucleate
- Each nucleation adds dimensional structure
- Boundaries with the "outside" are where this happens
- Universe grows at its edges

### 3.3 Mixed Model
- One original nucleation
- Internal sub-nucleations (new perspectives within)
- Healing processes (black holes?) at internal boundaries

---

## 4. Where External Perturbation Might Appear

These are places in the framework where "cause from outside" might become relevant:

### 4.1 Initial Nucleation
- If mechanism 2.1 (external cause) is correct
- The first perspective came from "outside"
- This would require defining what "outside" means

### 4.2 Black Holes as Healing
- Black holes might be where the crystal "heals" — recrystallizes
- The healing process might involve interaction with the perfect structure outside
- Singularities as points where inside meets outside
- **To investigate**: Does the black hole entropy formula connect here?

### 4.3 New Perspective Creation (Internal)
- Within the already-nucleated structure, new perspectives arise
- Observers, measurement, consciousness
- These might be "sub-nucleations" — new symmetry breaks within the existing break
- **To investigate**: Is observer-creation analogous to the original nucleation?

### 4.4 Cosmic Horizons
- The boundary of our observable universe
- Where our defect-region meets the undifferentiated crystal?
- New structure might emerge here
- **To investigate**: Does dark energy / cosmological expansion connect?

## 5. Revised Primitive Structure

Based on this session's discussion, a cleaner ontological starting point:

### What's Actually Primitive
```
1. The "Crystal" — undifferentiated potentiality
2. Perspective — the capacity for partial access
3. Nucleation — the process by which perspective breaks symmetry
```

### What Emerges
```
From nucleation:
  → Dimensions (directions of symmetry break)
  → Basis structure B

From dimensional overlap:
  → Points P (where dimensions intersect)
  → Locality (nearness = shared dimensions)

From perspective interaction:
  → Overlap γ (shared dimensional access)
  → Adjacency (which perspectives can interact)
  → Information structure
```

### What We Don't Know
- Why THIS pattern of dimensions (why 4 perceived, 11 total?)
- Whether nucleation is single or ongoing
- The mechanism of nucleation (necessary vs. caused)

---

## 6. Implications for Existing Framework

### The Old Layer 0 (layer_0_pure_axioms.md)
- Starts with U = (P, Σ, Γ, C, V, B)
- Treats P as fundamental
- This may need revision

### What Should Change
- P should be derived, not axiomatic
- B (dimensional structure) might be derived from nucleation
- The truly primitive objects are: {Crystal, Perspective, Nucleation}

### What Stays
- The perspective axioms (partiality, locality, non-invertibility)
- The overlap definition γ
- The information structure (I, S)

### Migration Path
1. Keep current Layer 0 as "emergent structure axioms"
2. Add new "deep foundations" layer beneath it
3. Show how P, B emerge from the deeper primitives
4. This is a future task, not today's work

## 7. Connection to Physics (Preview)

These foundational questions may connect to:

| Foundation Question | Possible Physics Connection |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Why 4 perceived dimensions? | Spectral dimension running |
| Why 11 total dimensions? | M-theory (if connection exists) |
| Nucleation mechanism | Big Bang, inflation |
| Ongoing nucleation | Cosmic expansion, dark energy |
| Healing processes | Black holes, entropy |
| New perspective creation | Measurement, decoherence |

**Status**: These are [SPECULATION] — connections to investigate, not claims.

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Formalize self-reference argument** — Can we make "Gödel-like incompleteness → perspective" rigorous?
2. **Investigate symmetry instability** — Mathematical models where perfect symmetry is unstable
3. **Define "the Crystal"** — What mathematical object is the undifferentiated background?
4. **Connect to black holes** — Does the healing metaphor have mathematical content?
5. **Revise Layer 0 axioms** — Make P derived rather than fundamental
