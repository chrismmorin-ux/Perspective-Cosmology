## 1. What We Started With

The original framework defined U as a 6-tuple:

```
U = (P, Σ, Γ, C, V, B)

P = finite set of points          ← ASSUMED FUNDAMENTAL
Σ = simplicial complex            ← connectivity
Γ = weights on simplices          ← connection strength
V = inner product space           ← content space
C = content map P → V             ← what exists at each point
B = orthonormal basis of V        ← reference frame
```

All six were treated as primitive or near-primitive.

## 2. What We Discovered

### 2.1 P Is Not Fundamental

**Key insight**: If we're describing perspective breaking crystalline structure, "points" aren't primitive locations — they're emergent.

**New understanding**:
```
Points emerge from overlapping orthogonality of perspectives.
```

A "point" is where multiple dimensions (basis vectors from B) have mutual non-trivial content. Points are INTERSECTIONS, not primitives.

### 2.2 The Revised Ontological Ordering

```
OLD:  P, V, B all primitive → perspectives defined on them

NEW:  Perspective → breaks symmetry → creates dimensions (B)
      → dimensions overlap → creates points (P)
      → everything else derives from this
```

### 2.3 Even Deeper: Where Does Perspective Come From?

Explored five candidates for perspective origin:

| Candidate | Type | Assessment |
|-----------|------|------------|
| External cause | Contingent | Not mathematical enough |
| Entropic inevitability | Contingent | No mechanism |
| **Self-reference instability** | **Necessary** | **Most promising** |
| Symmetry instability | Necessary | Secondary option |
| Nothing cannot exist | Necessary | Too philosophical |

**Recommended path**: Self-reference (Cantor/Gödel/Lawvere)
- Any structure rich enough to represent itself is incomplete
- The incompleteness gap IS perspective
- The gap's structure may determine dimensions

## 3. What We Did NOT Examine

We focused on P. The other five elements of U remain to be re-examined:

| Element | Original Role | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| ~~P~~ | Points | ✓ EXAMINED — now derived |
| **Σ** | Connectivity | NOT YET — needs re-examination |
| **Γ** | Weights | NOT YET — needs re-examination |
| **C** | Content map | NOT YET — needs re-examination |
| **V** | Value space | NOT YET — needs re-examination |
| **B** | Basis | PARTIALLY — emerges from nucleation, but what IS it? |

## 4. The New Picture (So Far)

```
"The Crystal"
    │
    │  (What is it? See crystal_structure.md)
    │
    ▼
Perspective nucleates
    │
    │  (Why? See perspective_origin.md)
    │
    ▼
Dimensions (B) emerge as "scars"
    │
    │  (How? See dimension_emergence.md)
    │
    ▼
Points (P) emerge from dimensional overlap
    │
    │  (Mechanism? See points_emergence.md)
    │
    ▼
Σ, Γ, C, V — ???
    │
    │  (NOT YET EXAMINED)
    │
    ▼
Full structure U

## 5. Key Questions for Next Session

### On the Remaining Elements

1. **Σ (Connectivity)**: If points emerge from dimensional overlap, does connectivity come "for free"? Two points sharing a dimension would naturally be connected.

2. **Γ (Weights)**: What determines connection strength? Is it degree of dimensional overlap? Number of shared perspectives?

3. **C (Content)**: What IS content in this picture? Is it fundamental, or does it emerge too?

4. **V (Value Space)**: Is V the "Crystal" itself? Or does V emerge from the collection of dimensions?

5. **B (Basis)**: We said B emerges from nucleation. But what determines its structure? Why orthonormal?

### On Consistency

- Do the new foundations still support the γ parameter?
- Do the physics results (α, sin²θ_W) survive the revision?
- Is the framework simpler or more complex after this revision?

## 7. Summary Statement

**We examined P and found it is not fundamental.**

Points emerge from overlapping orthogonality of perspective — where multiple dimensions (created by perspective breaking symmetry) intersect.

**Next**: Apply same scrutiny to Σ, Γ, C, V, B.
