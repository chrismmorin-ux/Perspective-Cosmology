## Summary

The dimensions of Hurwitz composition algebras {1, 2, 4, 8} are exactly the elements of D_framework that are Gaussian norms (representable as a^2 + b^2 with a, b in Z). The non-composition dimensions {3, 7, 11} are exactly the non-norms. This is the same partition that defines the CNH (Crystal Norm Hypothesis) classification.

**Moment map connection** (S278, THM_04B6): The G_2 moment map on Gr(4,11;R) provides a geometric manifestation of this partition. The zero locus has codimension 11 = n_c (a non-norm/non-composition dimension), while the symplectic reduction yields dimension 3 = Im_H (also non-composition). The composition algebra dimensions {1,2,4,8} generate the associative directions (dim 17), while the non-composition dimensions characterize the crystal constraints.

## The Identification

### Hurwitz Composition Algebras

A **composition algebra** over R is a (not necessarily associative) algebra A with a non-degenerate quadratic form N satisfying N(xy) = N(x)N(y). By Hurwitz's theorem [I-MATH], the only such algebras over R have dimensions:

| Algebra | Dimension | Composition? |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| R | 1 | Yes |
| C | 2 | Yes |
| H | 4 | Yes |
| O | 8 | Yes |

No other real composition algebras exist.

### CNH Gaussian Norm Classification

The framework dimension set D_fw = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11} is partitioned by the Gaussian norm N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2 in Z[i]:

| Dimension | Gaussian norm? | Composition algebra? |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1 = 0^2 + 1^2 | NORM | Yes (R) |
| 2 = 1^2 + 1^2 | NORM | Yes (C) |
| 3 = 3 mod 4 | NON-NORM (inert prime) | No |
| 4 = 0^2 + 2^2 | NORM | Yes (H) |
| 7 = 3 mod 4 | NON-NORM (inert prime) | No |
| 8 = 2^2 + 2^2 | NORM | Yes (O) |
| 11 = 3 mod 4 | NON-NORM (inert prime) | No |

**The partition is identical**: {1, 2, 4, 8} = NORM = composition; {3, 7, 11} = NON-NORM = non-composition.

## Why This Works

### The Number-Theoretic Connection

A positive integer n is representable as a^2 + b^2 (a Gaussian norm) if and only if every prime factor p = 3 mod 4 appears to an even power [I-MATH: Fermat-Euler theorem].

For the D_fw elements:
- 1 = 1 (trivially a norm)
- 2 = 1^2 + 1^2 (the unique ramified prime)
- 3 is prime, 3 = 3 mod 4 -> NOT a norm (inert in Z[i])
- 4 = 2^2 = 0^2 + 2^2 (norm)
- 7 is prime, 7 = 3 mod 4 -> NOT a norm (inert in Z[i])
- 8 = 2^3 = 2^2 + 2^2 (norm: 8 = 4 * 2, and 2 is a norm)
- 11 is prime, 11 = 3 mod 4 -> NOT a norm (inert in Z[i])

The non-norms {3, 7, 11} are exactly the inert primes in D_fw.

### The Algebraic Connection

Why should Gaussian norms correspond to composition algebra dimensions?

The composition algebra dimensions {1, 2, 4, 8} have the property that they are all powers of 2 times 1: {2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3}. The Cayley-Dickson construction doubles the dimension at each step.

The Gaussian norms are closed under multiplication: N(z)N(w) = N(zw). Similarly, composition algebra dimensions satisfy:
- dim(A) * dim(B) can produce a new composition algebra via Cayley-Dickson (when dim doubles)
- The set {1, 2, 4, 8} is {2^k : k = 0, 1, 2, 3}, which is multiplicatively generated by 2

The non-composition dimensions {3, 7, 11} arise as the IMAGINARY dimensions of C, H, O:
- Im_C = 1 (but n_c uses all imaginary dims: 1+3+7 = 11)
- Im_H = 3
- Im_O = 7

And 3, 7, 11 are all primes congruent to 3 mod 4.

### Deeper Structure?

The coincidence may reflect a deeper fact: the Gaussian norm N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2 is itself the norm of the SIMPLEST composition algebra C = R[i]. The norm of C classifies the D_fw elements by whether they "fit" the composition algebra structure.

In other words: **C (the field forced by CCP) provides the norm that distinguishes composition from non-composition dimensions.** This is not circular because:
1. CCP forces F = C (the field) [DERIVED, CCP-4]
2. C defines Z[i] and the Gaussian norm [I-MATH]
3. The Gaussian norm classifies D_fw [THEOREM, S244]
4. The classification matches Hurwitz's composition/non-composition boundary [THEOREM, S258]

## Implications

### For the CNH Classification

The Hurwitz connection strengthens the CNH classification by providing an independent characterization: the norm/non-norm partition is not just a number-theoretic curiosity -- it separates composition algebras (where N(xy) = N(x)N(y)) from non-composition structures (where the norm is not multiplicative).

### Physical Interpretation [Layer 2]

In the crystallization catalog (S250):
- **NORM dimensions** {1, 2, 4, 8} -> gravity sector (n_d = 4 is a norm)
- **NON-NORM dimensions** {3, 7, 11} -> color sector (N_c = 3, Im_O = 7 are non-norms)
- **BRIDGE primes** (e.g., 137 = 4^2 + 11^2) -> electromagnetic/electroweak sector

The Hurwitz connection suggests: gravity (spacetime) is the domain of composition algebras (where the norm is multiplicative = energy is conserved in products). Color confinement is the domain of non-composition structures (where algebraic closure fails).

This is [SPECULATION] -- the physical interpretation is suggestive but not derived.

### For Remaining Conjectures

The Hurwitz-CNH connection does not directly attack any remaining conjecture (A1, A2, B1). However, it provides structural vocabulary:
- **CONJ-A1**: The spectral function lives in the composition algebra sector (gauge coupling from the norm)
- **CONJ-B1**: The quartic potential involves Tr(eps^2) and Tr(eps^4) -- both even powers, corresponding to norms

## Derivation Chain

```
CCP [A-AXIOM] -> D_fw = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11} [DERIVED]
CCP [A-AXIOM] -> F = C [DERIVED, CCP-4]
F = C -> Z[i] = Gaussian integers [I-MATH]
Z[i] -> Gaussian norm N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2 [I-MATH]
Fermat-Euler -> n is a norm iff no p=3(mod 4) at odd power [I-MATH]
-> D_fw partitions: {1,2,4,8} = norms, {3,7,11} = non-norms [THEOREM, S244]
Hurwitz -> composition algebra dims = {1,2,4,8} [I-MATH]
-> Gaussian norms = composition dimensions [THEOREM, S258]
```
