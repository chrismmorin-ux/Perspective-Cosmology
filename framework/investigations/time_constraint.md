# Constraint: Time and Perspective

**Status**: CONSTRAINT (applies to all investigations)
**Created**: 2026-01-26
**Confidence**: [AXIOM-LEVEL]
**Purpose**: Document the fundamental relationship between time and perspective

---

## 1. The Constraint

**Time only exists relative to perspective.**

Outside perspective, there is no time. The Crystal is timeless.

---

## 2. What This Means

### In the Crystal (No Perspective)

```
No perspective → No time
No "before" and "after"
No dynamics in the usual sense
The Crystal simply IS
```

### With Perspective

```
Perspective exists → Time emerges
Time = sequence of perspective transitions (adjacency)
"Before" = earlier in the adjacency chain
"After" = later in the adjacency chain
```

---

## 3. Implications for Our Investigations

### 3.1 "Healing" and "Dynamics"

When we wrote about tilts healing or content evolving, we implicitly used time.

**Clarification needed**:
- These processes happen IN perspective-time, not external time
- The Crystal doesn't "slowly heal" in some meta-time
- From the Crystal's "view" (if it had one), nothing happens

### 3.2 "Nucleation"

When we ask "how does perspective nucleate?":
- This isn't a temporal question
- It's a structural/logical question
- Perspective doesn't nucleate "at a moment" — there's no moment before perspective

### 3.3 Causation

"A causes B" means:
- In the perspective-sequence, A precedes B
- Not that A temporally precedes B in some external time

---

## 4. Re-reading Our Documents

Several documents use temporal language. This should be understood as:

| We Wrote | Should Be Read As |
|----------|-------------------|
| "Perspective nucleates" | Structural relationship, not temporal event |
| "Tilts heal" | Process within perspective-sequence |
| "Dimensions emerge" | Logical/structural emergence |
| "The Crystal wants orthogonality" | Structural tendency, not temporal striving |
| "Over time, εᵢⱼ → 0" | In perspective-sequence, transitions favor lower ε |

---

## 5. The Perspective-Time Definition

From the framework (core/08_time.md and related):

```
Time for perspective π = sequence of valid adjacencies π → π' → π'' → ...
```

Each step in the sequence is a "moment."

Duration = number of steps.

---

## 6. Consequences

### 6.1 No "Before the Big Bang"

If the Big Bang = nucleation of perspective:
- There's no time before it
- "What caused the Big Bang?" isn't a temporal question
- It's asking about the logical/structural conditions for perspective

### 6.2 Black Hole Interiors

If black holes = healing toward perfect orthogonality:
- Inside, perspective dissolves
- Time dissolves with it
- The singularity isn't a "moment" — it's the absence of time

### 6.3 The Crystal's "State"

The Crystal doesn't have a state that evolves.
The Crystal IS.
All possible perspectives and their sequences are "in" the Crystal structurally.

## 7. Flag for Future Work

When developing dynamics (healing rates, field equations, etc.):
- Must use perspective-relative time
- No external time parameter
- Evolution is along adjacency chains, not in background time

*This constraint applies to all investigation documents.*
*When reading "time" language, substitute "perspective-sequence position."*
