# Framework Directory

Physical interpretation of the mathematical framework — bridge between pure axioms and testable predictions.

## Structure

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `layer_0_pure_axioms.md` | Pure perspective axioms (NO physics) |
| `layer_1_crystallization.md` | Mathematical consequences |
| `layer_2_correspondence.md` | Explicit physics imports |
| `layer_3_predictions.md` | Testable predictions |
| `investigations/` | Deep-dive analysis files (150+ files) |
| `investigations/_INDEX.md` | Master index of all investigations |

## Investigation Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| CANONICAL | Verified, complete — reference freely |
| ACTIVE | Work in progress |
| QUARANTINE | Known gaps — fix before using |
| ARCHIVE | Superseded/failed — learn from |

## Requirements

Every investigation file needs: Status header, Question, Findings (with confidence tags), Verification script links, Dependencies, Session history.

Every claim needs: confidence tag, `[A]/[I]/[D]` derivation chain, assumption list with `[A-IMPORT]` values.
