## Intent Contract (ADR-038)

Before phase work, read the `engine_intent_recorded` event from the loaded envelope (look-back 5 min, match on `engine: drift-detector` + target). The contract carries four fields this engine MUST honor:

- **`mode`** — output shape. Frontmatter declares `default_mode: decide`. Specializations: `decide` (comparison/audit/scoring with tradeoffs), `build-best` (commit to one direction; concrete deliverable; sequencing-ranked), `mockup` (low-fidelity sketch; structure-only; skip scoring + work-item creation), `explore` (surface adjacent possibilities; emphasize divergence over selection). When the loaded contract specifies a mode that differs from the default, honor the contract; the briefing's Contract Alignment block records the departure.
- **`stretch`** — when `true`, question the AS-N tags + constraints already loaded in the envelope; surface where current state is load-bearing vs. inertial. When `false` (default), honor loaded state. **Stretch MUST NOT re-read `system/` files** — INV-cli-envelope-consumed-completely applies.
- **`success_shape`** — the structured target the briefing phase MUST honor. The Briefing's Contract Alignment block reports honored vs. departed items with reason.
- **`scope_ceiling`** — items listed here are out-of-bounds. Do not spend cycles on them; briefing's Contract Alignment block reports compliance.

# Drift Detector Engine

Detects drift between what's documented and what's true, identifies stale assumptions, and generates new work through introspective questioning.

## Focus Area

$ARGUMENTS (or "full" if not provided)

---

## PHASE 0 — GATHER CONTEXT

Read all system state files:
1. `system/state.md` — documented vital signs and metrics
2. `system/invariants.md` — rules that must hold
3. `system/constraints.md` — assumptions and boundaries
4. `system/decisions.md` — past decisions with dates
5. `system/failures.md` — known failure modes
6. `CLAUDE.md` — project spec
7. `.claude/workstream/programs/` — all program definitions
8. `.claude/workstream/queue/` — current work items
9. `.claude/workstream/engines/registry.yaml` — available engines

---

## PHASE 1 — DRIFT DETECTION

### 1a. State Drift
The mechanical parts — count comparison and freshness — ship as scripts, not AI
tallying (determinism-first; `INV-readpath-determinism`):
- `node kit/scripts/cwos-workstream-snapshot.js` — authoritative queue/sprint
  counts. Compare against what `system/state.md` documents; flag mismatches.
- `node kit/scripts/cwos-staleness.js` — canonical files past their freshness SLA
  (including `system/state.md`); flag what it returns.
- `node kit/scripts/cwos-reconcile.js` is the *healer* for event-log↔YAML drift —
  note its output if it reconciled anything.

Consume the scripts' output; do NOT hand-tally `queue/` files or eyeball timestamps.

### 1b. Invariant Drift
Invariant checking is the canonical checker's job. Run
`node kit/scripts/cwos-verify.js` and surface any `[FAIL]`; do not re-implement
each invariant's check command/pattern in prose.

### 1c. Decision Drift
Scan `system/decisions.md`:
- Decisions older than 90 days → flag for re-evaluation
- Decisions referencing files that no longer exist → flag
- Decisions with consequences that haven't been addressed → flag

### 1d. Documentation Drift
- Files referenced in CLAUDE.md that don't exist
- Commands listed that don't have skill files
- Architecture descriptions that don't match file structure

---

## PHASE 2 — STALENESS DETECTION

### 2a. Program Staleness
Overdue-protocol detection is deterministic — run
`node kit/scripts/cwos-protocol-cadence-check.js` (overdue protocols vs cadence)
and `node kit/scripts/cwos-staleness.js`; consume their output rather than
reading every `prog-*.yaml` by hand. The remaining judgment — whether
`scope_paths` saw *substantive* unreviewed change — is the AI's:
`git log --oneline --since="<last_reviewed>" -- <paths>` and assess.

### 2b. Assumption Staleness
For each assumption in `system/constraints.md`:
- Check `last_verified` date
- If > 30 days: flag for re-verification
- If assumption references external systems: flag for freshness check

### 2c. Failure Library Staleness
For each entry in `system/failures.md`:
- Are the prevention measures still in place?
- Has the same root cause appeared again?
- Has the codebase changed around the failure point?

---

## PHASE 3 — INTROSPECTIVE QUESTIONING (AGENT DISPATCH)

Generate new work by dispatching 3 agents in parallel, each tackling 2 introspective questions through their expert lens.

### Agent 1: Failure Engineer (dispatch using `failure-engineer` persona)

> Analyze this project through two failure-focused lenses:
>
> **Question 1: "What breaks at 100x scale?"**
> For each major system component:
> - Database: what if data volume is 100x? Missing indexes? Unbounded queries?
> - API: what if request rate is 100x? Rate limiting? Connection pools?
> - Storage: what if file/blob count is 100x?
> - Processing: what if computation load is 100x?
>
> **Question 2: "What would a hostile user do?"**
> Walk through each user-facing endpoint/feature:
> - Identify: injection points, authorization gaps, abuse potential
> - Flag anything not covered by security invariants
>
> Read the codebase, system/constraints.md, and system/invariants.md. Produce specific findings with file paths.

### Agent 2: Systems Architect (dispatch using `architect` persona)

> Analyze this project through two architecture-focused lenses:
>
> **Question 1: "What assumptions haven't been tested?"**
> - Read system/constraints.md — list all assumptions
> - Cross-reference with test suite — which assumptions have test coverage?
> - Flag untested assumptions as potential blind spots
>
> **Question 2: "What patterns keep recurring?"**
> - Read system/failures.md — group failures by root_cause_category
> - If 3+ failures share a category: the class of bug needs elimination
> - Propose structural fixes for recurring categories
>
> Read the codebase and system state files. Produce specific findings.

### Agent 3: Senior Engineer (dispatch using `senior-engineer` persona)

> Analyze this project through two quality-focused lenses:
>
> **Question 1: "What engines should exist but don't?"**
> - Read .claude/workstream/engines/registry.yaml for installed engines
> - Based on the project type and codebase, what analysis domains have no engine coverage?
> - What types of problems keep appearing that an engine could catch?
> - Suggest new engines to build via `/build-engine`
>
> **Question 2: "What would embarrass us in a code review?"**
> - Scan for: TODO/FIXME/HACK comments older than 30 days
> - Check for: commented-out code, dead code paths, unused exports
> - Look for: inconsistent error handling, missing input validation
>
> Read the codebase. Produce specific findings with file paths.

Wait for all 3 agents to return. Merge their findings.

**Error Handling:**
- If an agent returns empty output: note which agent failed, proceed with remaining agents
- If fewer than 2 agents return usable output: warn user, introspective analysis is incomplete
- If no agents return: skip Phase 3 entirely, proceed to Phase 4 with only drift/staleness findings from Phases 1-2

### Infrastructure Drift Check (automated, not agent)

Additionally, check for CWOS infrastructure drift:
- Read `.cwos-version` if it exists — compare against current HomeBase version
- Read engine registry — check against HomeBase engine INDEX for new engines available
- Flag any "CWOS update available" as a MEDIUM finding

---

## PHASE 4 — GENERATE FINDINGS

For all drift, staleness, and introspective issues found:
- Create findings with appropriate severity
- Group findings by category for clarity
- Create work items for actionable findings

**WS-id allocation (WS-040):** allocate every new work item's id via `node kit/scripts/cwos-next.js allocate-ws-id` — call it once per id, in order. Do NOT compute the next id by eyeballing the active-queue max: that scan misses `queue/archive/` and re-issues retired ids, which lets reconcile force-complete the new item (the SPR-018 / WS-033 incident). The CLI scans queue + archive + index.

---

## PHASE 5 — REPORT

```

---

## Contract Alignment (ADR-038)

The briefing/output phase MUST emit this block (per ADR-038 Decision #6):

```
### Contract Alignment
- mode: <honored | departed (reason)>
- stretch: <honored | departed (reason)>
- success_shape: <honored — list which target items hit | departed (reason)>
- scope_ceiling: <complied — items skipped: [list] | violated (reason)>
```
