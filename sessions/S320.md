# Session S320: DM-3b -- Spinor Gap Analysis -> SU(3) Correction

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: Resolve spinor gap (8/16 SM fermions from SO(11) spinor) -- discovered fundamental SU(3) misidentification
**Topic**: Dark matter / irreducible assumptions (IRA-09)
**Status**: COMPLETE (CORRECTION SESSION)
**Previous**: S319 (DM-3a: Dark sector spectrum + asymmetry transfer)

---

## Outcome

Session began with spinor gap analysis but discovered a **fundamental structural error**: SU(3) c G_2 c SO(7) is COLOR SU(3)_c, not a generation symmetry. This invalidates S299's IRA-09 resolution and S319's dark sector counting. Three independent arguments establish the correction (SM pipeline, lepton test, mutual exclusivity). The S320 Phase 1 results (B-D portal, triality) are also RETRACTED as they depend on SU(3) = generation.

**This is a CORRECTION session.** Key changes: IRA-09 resolution retracted, S319 "8 dark states" retracted, DM particle identity reopened.

## Key Findings

1. **SU(3) c G_2 = color, not generation** [DERIVATION, 3 independent arguments]:
   - **SM pipeline** (S251): Framework derives u(1)xsu(2)xsu(3) from G_2. This SU(3) IS color by construction.
   - **Lepton test** [DECISIVE]: SM leptons are SU(3) singlets but come in 3 generations. If SU(3) = generation, singlet states get 1 copy -> only 1 lepton generation (WRONG). SU(3) = color gives leptons = singlets correctly.
   - **Mutual exclusivity**: SU(3) can't be both color and generation (gluon FCNCs excluded by K-Kbar mixing, ratio > 10^4).

2. **IRA-09 resolution RETRACTED**: S299 claimed 7->3+3bar+1 gives 3 generations. WRONG. The 3+3bar+1 = 3 colors + lepton (Pati-Salam "lepton as 4th color" pattern). Generations come from dim(Im(H)) = 3 through a separate mechanism.

3. **Spinor gap is an ARTIFACT**: With SU(3) = color, the SO(11) spinor 32 gives exactly 1 complete SM generation (16 particles + 16 anti-particles). There is no "gap" and no dark states from spinor decomposition.

4. **S319 dark sector counting RETRACTED**: The "8 dark states" from spinor were counted by treating SU(3) branching as generation-multiplying. With SU(3) = color, all 32 spinor components are SM particles. No dark states from this mechanism.

5. **S320 Phase 1 RETRACTED**: B-D portal, SU(3)_gen triality, proton stability unification -- all based on SU(3) = generation, all INVALIDATED.

6. **What SURVIVES from DM program**:
   - m_DM = m_e*(n_c-1)^n_d = 5.11 GeV [DERIVATION, structural, independent of SU(3) identification]
   - g_{h,DM} = 0 for SM singlets [DERIVATION, independent]
   - Omega split mechanism [DERIVATION, independent]
   - Asymmetric DM ratio match (1.5%, 1.3 sigma) [observation, independent]
   - DM PARTICLE IDENTITY reopened (not a spinor dark state)

## Open Questions

1. **DM particle identity** (NEW): What IS the dark matter particle if not a spinor dark state? Mass formula m_DM = m_e*(n_c-1)^n_d survives but needs a new particle candidate.
2. **Generation mechanism formalization**: dim(Im(H)) = 3 provides generations, but the mechanism needs explicit formalization. Does this require a new IRA?
3. **S212 consistency**: S212 (fermion embedding) used SU(3) = color correctly ("32 = 16 + 16' where one 16 = 15 SM + nu_R"). The S299 misidentification was an UNFORCED error.

## Retraction Details

### What went wrong (HP-013)

S299 claimed SU(3) c G_2 is a "generation SU(3)" different from color. This was never properly justified -- the framework has only ONE SU(3) from the G_2 subgroup chain, and S251 already identified it as color. The Weinberg criterion was misapplied in S299: the "3 copies" in 7->3+3bar+1 have identical gauge quantum numbers only if SU(3) ISN'T the gauge group -- but it IS.

### Impact cascade

- IRA-09 resolution: RETRACTED (question reopened with different mechanism)
- S319 "8 dark states": RETRACTED (no dark states from spinor)
- S320 Phase 1 (B-D portal, triality): RETRACTED (SU(3)_gen doesn't exist)
- EQ-043: Partially reset (B-D portal result removed)
- DM particle identity: REOPENED
- IRA count: Unchanged (IRA-09 already counted as "resolved" so doesn't affect the 4)

### What survives

All DM results independent of SU(3) identification survive intact: mass formula, coupling suppression, Omega split, asymmetric ratio match. The structural predictions are robust.

## Key Context for Next Session

S320 is a CORRECTION session. The DM program's SU(3)-dependent results (dark spectrum, B-D portal) are retracted, but the core predictions (mass, coupling, abundance ratio) survive. The generation mechanism needs formalization via dim(Im(H)) = 3. The DM particle identity (what IS the dark matter?) is the key reopened question. Consider whether to continue DM thread with corrected framework or pursue a different topic.
