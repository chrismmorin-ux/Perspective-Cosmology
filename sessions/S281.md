# Session S281: Yang-Mills — Remaining Gaps Exploration

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: L>=2 diagnostic, base mass derivation, normalization principle assessment
**Topic**: Gauge theory / Yang-Mills
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S277 (Yang-Mills: exotic gluon cost derivation)
**Next**: EQ-041 (Landau coefficients); lattice monitoring for L>=2 states; overall Yang-Mills summary

---

## Outcome

Three remaining gaps explored systematically. (1) L>=2 diagnostic: formula has clear regime of validity at L<=1 (6 states, avg ~4%); L=2 breaks down at 15-31% due to non-linear string dynamics, as physically expected. (2) Base mass: upgraded from [CONJECTURE] HRS=5 to [DERIVATION with A-PHYSICAL] HRS=3 via three convergent routes (mode counting, Casimir product, uniqueness). The identity 2*(d-2) = d uniquely at d=4 connects the base mass to the S274 uniqueness theorem. (3) Normalization principle: classified as irreducible [A-PHYSICAL] with structural support from mode decomposition; comparable to I-STRUCT-5. Two new scripts, 48/48 PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **L>=2 regime of validity** [DERIVATION]: The formula's domain is L<=1. Within this regime, 6 states match lattice at avg ~4%. L=2 states are overestimated by 15-31% (3++: 31%, 1++: 18%). No simple correction fixes L>=2 without degrading L<=1. The breakdown is physical: the additive/Casimir formula describes small excitations, while L>=2 requires non-linear string dynamics.

2. **Base mass Route A: mode counting** [THEOREM + A-PHYSICAL]: Each gluon has dim_C transverse DOF. A 2-gluon state has 2*dim_C = n_d modes (uniquely at d=4). Each mode contributes sqrt(sigma). Identity: 2*(d-2) = d has unique solution d=4, a companion to the S274 uniqueness theorem. Both follow from dim_C = n_d/2.

3. **Base mass Route B: Casimir product** [DERIVATION + A-PHYSICAL]: C_2(F) * C_2(A) = (N_c^2-1)/2 = dim(O)/2 = n_d = 4. The product of fundamental and adjoint Casimirs equals the spacetime dimension. Physical: glueball ground-state energy = (fundamental binding) * (adjoint self-coupling) * sqrt(sigma).

4. **Base mass Route C: uniqueness** [DERIVATION]: n_d = 4 is the unique simple framework match to both lattice references (Chen: 3.92, M&P: 4.21). 8 equivalent expressions all give 4. Nearest competitor n_c/Im_H = 3.67 is 7-13% off.

5. **Normalization principle** [A-PHYSICAL with structural support]: Spatial symmetries (Casimir/n_d) distribute energy across the n_d modes of the flux tube. Internal symmetries (Casimir/1) act at the point-like junction. The spin cost has an independent derivation (S274) that doesn't rely on this principle. Classified as irreducible [A-PHYSICAL], comparable to I-STRUCT-5.

6. **Complete formula status**: ALL terms now [DERIVATION with A-PHYSICAL]. Two irreducible [A-PHYSICAL] assumptions remain: (1) constituent picture for base mass, (2) internal Casimir normalization for gluon cost.

## Open Questions

1. **EQ-041**: Landau coefficients a_3, a_4 remain free [A-STRUCTURAL]. Would need Coleman-Weinberg calculation from O-channel tilt dynamics. The a_2 = n_d^2*sigma/2 constraint from the mass gap is now structural. Deferred unless new insights emerge.
2. **L>=2 string corrections**: Could the Nambu-Goto or Polchinski-Strominger correction be expressed in framework quantities? Low priority.
3. **Lattice monitoring**: Improved lattice data for 1-+ exotic glueball (currently 0.5% as ratio) would provide the strongest test.

## Key Context for Next Session

The Yang-Mills mass gap investigation is now SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE. The glueball mass formula has all terms at [DERIVATION with A-PHYSICAL] status, a clear regime of validity (L<=1, 6 states), 207/207 PASS across 9 scripts, and two identified irreducible assumptions. The remaining gaps (EQ-041 Landau coefficients, L>=2 corrections) connect to the Millennium Prize and are appropriately left as OPEN. The investigation could be promoted to CANONICAL for the L<=1 spectrum with the documented limitations.
