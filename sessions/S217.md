# Session 217: Mass Scale f — Democratic Bilinear Principle

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Derive the compositeness scale f from first principles (EQ-020)
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S214 (xi effects computed, value not derived), S215 (democratic counting for Weinberg angle)

---

## Outcome

Systematic survey of four approaches to deriving xi = n_d/n_c^2 = 4/121 (and hence f = v*n_c/2 = 1354 GeV). Two approaches eliminated (B: not independent, D: no clean mechanism), one blocked (C: needs composite sector dynamics). Approach A yielded the **Unified Democratic Bilinear Principle**: both xi = 4/121 and sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121 arise from democratic counting on End(V) = End(R^11), the bilinear order parameter space. This unifies EQ-004, EQ-007, and EQ-020 under a single mechanism with a single residual gap: "why democratic counting instead of Dynkin-weighted counting?" — the same gap identified in S215.

## Key Findings

### 1. Four-Approach Survey [DERIVATION for structure]

| Approach | Method | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| A: Geometric | ξ from End(V) mode counting | **MOST PROMISING** — key identities found |
| B: f/M_Pl | f from v formula × n_c/2 | NOT INDEPENDENT — just combines v formula with ξ |
| C: CW alignment | ξ = α/(2β) from Coleman-Weinberg | BLOCKED — c_beta ≈ 1.819, nearest candidate π²/6 = 1.645 (9.6% off) |
| D: Dimensional transmutation | f from RG running | RULED OUT — b₀g² = 2.308, no clean factoring |

### 2. Democratic Bilinear Principle [CONJECTURE — gap: "why democratic?"]

The bilinear order parameter space End(V) = End(R^11) has dim = n_c^2 = 121, decomposing under SO(n_d) x SO(Im_O) = SO(4) x SO(7) as:

```
End(W)          = n_d^2    = 16   (defect self-interaction)
Hom(W^perp, W)  = n_d*Im_O = 28   (hidden → visible transitions)
Hom(W, W^perp)  = Im_O*n_d = 28   (visible → hidden transitions)
End(W^perp)     = Im_O^2   = 49   (hidden self-interaction)
```

**Vacuum alignment**: The Higgs doublet occupies N_Higgs = n_d = 4 modes within End(V). Democratic counting gives:
- ξ = N_Higgs / dim(End(V)) = n_d / n_c^2 = 4/121 [CONJECTURE]

**Weinberg angle**: Gauge connections occupy N_coset = n_d × Im_O = 28 modes. Democratic counting gives:
- sin^2(theta_W) = N_coset / dim(End(V)) = 28/121 [CONJECTURE]

Both are unified through the Bernoulli parameter p = n_d/n_c = 4/11:
- sin^2(theta_W) = p(1-p) = 28/121 (variance of defect fraction)
- ξ = p/n_c = p^2/n_d = 4/121 (defect fraction per crystal dimension)

### 3. Key Identity: N_I = n_c^2 + n_d^2 = 137

The "information dimension" 137 = 121 + 16 = dim(End(V)) + dim(End(W)). This connects the bilinear order parameter space to the electromagnetic coupling 1/alpha ≈ 137. The crystal modes (121) and defect modes (16) together span the full coupling.

### 4. Additional Structural Identities

- ξ = sin^2(theta_W) / Im_O — vacuum alignment is Weinberg angle per hidden imaginary dimension
- ξ = N_Higgs / n_c^2 — Higgs fraction of bilinear space
- f = M_Pl × α^8 × n_c × √(n_c/Im_O) — no free parameters beyond M_Pl (but NOT independent of v formula)

### 5. Residual Gap

**Why democratic counting?** Each End(V) mode contributes equally (weight 1) rather than proportionally to its Dynkin index. This is the SAME gap identified in S215 for the Weinberg angle. Four candidate resolutions (from S215):
- (i) First-order transition forces non-perturbative democratic weights
- (ii) Lattice: on discrete End(V), coupling = nearest-neighbor counting
- (iii) Information-theoretic: coupling = information transfer fraction
- (iv) Emergent gauge field: collective mode → geometric (HS norm) coupling

## Open Questions

1. **Why democratic counting?** (EQ-004/EQ-007/EQ-020 shared gap): Can the first-order nature of the SO(11) transition (proven S211) be shown to produce equal mode weights non-perturbatively?
2. **SU(3) mode test** (EQ-008): Does the democratic formula predict 1/alpha_s correctly via SU(3) decomposition of End(V)?
3. **c_beta gap**: CW approach needs c_beta ≈ 1.819; nearest framework candidate π²/6 = 1.645 (9.6% off). Is there a correction?

## Key Context for Next Session

Four approaches to deriving xi = 4/121 surveyed. The **Democratic Bilinear Principle** unifies xi and sin^2(theta_W) as fractions of dim(End(V)) = n_c^2 = 121: xi = n_d/n_c^2 (4 Higgs modes out of 121) and sin^2(theta_W) = (n_d × Im_O)/n_c^2 (28 coset modes out of 121). Both arise from the Bernoulli parameter p = 4/11. This connects EQ-004, EQ-007, and EQ-020 under one principle. The single remaining gap is "why democratic counting?" — shared with S215. Most promising resolution: the first-order phase transition (S211) forces non-perturbative equal mode weights. This needs a concrete argument, possibly from sigma-model lattice calculations or the structure of first-order transitions.
