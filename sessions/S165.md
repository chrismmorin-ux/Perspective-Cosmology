# Session 165 — 2026-01-31

**Focus**: Formalize Gap G2 (generic direction -> uniform superposition) + resolve two counting regimes
**Topic**: `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S164 (THM_04A2 formalization, 137-mode sector decomposition)

## Outcome

Gap G2 — the highest-severity open gap in the single-photon tilt derivation of alpha (THM_04A2) — is now CLOSED. The counting metric that forces uniform probability P(k)=1/137 across all interface modes is the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, derived from AXM_0110 (crystal orthonormality). This upgrades Gap G2 from [A-STRUCTURAL] to [D: derived from AXM_0110]. The two counting regimes (EW fraction vs strong dimension) are resolved as different physical quantities, not competing methods.

## Key Findings

### 1. Irreducible decomposition of V_pi [THEOREM]

Under the adjoint action of G = U(n_d) x U(n_c), the 137-dimensional space V_pi decomposes into 4 irreducible blocks:

| Block | Dimension | Representation |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| u(1)_d | 1 | trivial |
| su(n_d) | 15 | adjoint of SU(4) |
| u(1)_c | 1 | trivial |
| su(n_c) | 120 | adjoint of SU(11) |

Schur's lemma forces P(k) constant within each block but leaves 3 free parameters (4 block probabilities minus normalization). The uniform distribution P(k)=1/137 requires cross-block equality.

### 2. Counting metric = Hilbert-Schmidt inner product [DERIVATION]

The HS inner product <X,Y> = Tr(X^dag Y) gives ALL generators unit norm regardless of which Lie algebra factor they belong to. This is the counting metric.

Derivation chain:
```
AXM_0110 (orthonormal basis) => HS inner product [D]
=> all generators have unit norm [D]
=> AXM_0114 (no preferred direction) + max entropy => rho = I/N_I [D]
=> Born rule => P(k) = 1/N_I [D]
```

The HS inner product is functorial (determined by the geometry, not group structure). The Killing form, by contrast, gives |B(E,E)| = 2n, so u(4) generators get norm 8 and u(11) generators get norm 22 — experimentally ruled out (1/alpha = 126.8, 7.5% error).

### 3. Killing metric ruled out [DERIVATION]

Killing metric: 1/alpha = 1395/11 ~ 126.8 (7.5% error from measured 137.036).
Counting/HS metric: 1/alpha = 137 (0.026% error).
Experiment strongly selects HS over Killing.

### 4. Random pure states do NOT give uniformity [THEOREM]

A Haar-random pure state on C^137 gives mode probabilities distributed as Beta(1,136). The relative standard deviation is ~99%. Random pure states are NOT approximately uniform. The uniform distribution requires the maximally mixed density matrix rho = I/N_I, not a random pure state.

### 5. Two counting regimes resolved [CONJECTURE]

Coupling constants (alpha, alpha_s) are inverse mode counts: 1/alpha_i ~ N_modes.
Mixing angles (sin^2 theta_W) are mode fractions: sin^2 theta = N_sub/N_total.
These are different physical quantities (inverse count vs ratio), not competing "regimes."

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **THM_0491 (Hilbert space)**: Still SKETCH. Can the Hilbert space structure be derived more rigorously from the algebraic completeness axiom?
2. **Born rule (THM_0494, Gap G3)**: The noise model is [A-STRUCTURAL]. Can it be derived from crystallization dynamics?
3. **10 Cartan generators**: Still unassigned physically. Do they have a role?
4. **Goldstone fraction mechanism**: Is sin^2(theta_W) = N_Gold/n_c^2 derivable from dynamics?

## Key Context for Next Session

The alpha derivation chain (THM_04A2) now has its metric gap closed. The remaining gaps are G1 (Hilbert space structure, SKETCH) and G3 (Born rule, SKETCH). The counting metric is no longer an assumption — it follows from AXM_0110 via the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. Step 5 of the alpha mechanism has been upgraded from grade D+ to approximately C (the SKETCH dependencies on THM_0491 and THM_0494 prevent a higher grade). The two counting regimes are now understood as different physical operations, not competing methods.
