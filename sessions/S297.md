# Session S297: CONJ-A2 Attack -- Gauge Kinetic Induction (Alpha Step 15)

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Resolve CONJ-A2 (IRA-01): the sole remaining conjecture in the alpha derivation chain
**Topic**: `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S295 (EQ-008 beta coefficients), S292 (CONJ-A1 resolved), S288 (Step 5 irreducibility analysis)
**Next**: New physics topic, LLM Challenge v3, or IRA-04 attack

---

## Outcome

**CONJ-A2 PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: Step 15 (interface = 1/alpha) upgraded from [CONJECTURE] to [A-STRUCTURAL within I-STRUCT-5]. The alpha derivation chain now has **0 axiom assumptions + 1 structural convention + 0 conjectures**. The irreducible content is kappa = 1, which corresponds to the standard (unnormalized) Hilbert-Schmidt inner product <A,B> = Tr(A^dag B).

## Key Findings

1. **DE-009 does NOT block current approaches** [THEOREM, Phase 1]: DE-009 (S145) blocks Sub-problem B (photon = democratic superposition of 137 modes), but the active WSR/HS-metric approach concerns Sub-problems A+C (gauge kinetic coefficient and normalization). No hidden obstruction. 12/12 PASS.

2. **Sigma model one-loop: sum(Q^2)_coset = 14, not 137** [OBSERVATION, Phase 2]: The 28 real pNGB scalars on SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) have total EM charge content sum(Q^2) = 14 = 2*Im_O. This is NOT 137. The generator-level sum is S_EM = 126 = 6*Im_H*Im_O. Factor-of-9 gap (126/14 = 9). C = 24/11 IS consistent: colored pNGB subset gives sum(Q^2) = 12. 12/12 PASS.

3. **kappa = 1 = standard Tr convention** [A-STRUCTURAL, Phase 3]: WSR + Schur (S292) gives 1/g_i^2 = kappa * N_i. Three normalization candidates tested:
   - (A) Tr(I) = n_c: gives kappa = 1/n_c (WRONG, off by factor n_c)
   - (B) Born rule totality: gives kappa = 1 with unit weight per generator
   - (C) Standard HS (Tr convention): gives kappa = 1 directly
   Only kappa = 1 matches observations. Alternatives (1/n_c, 1/4pi, 1/n_d, 2/pi) off by >10%. 10/10 PASS.

4. **EQ-002/EQ-003 duality** [STRONGEST EVIDENCE]: One parameter (kappa = 1) gives TWO independent predictions:
   - alpha_tree = 1/137 (electromagnetic coupling, 0.0002 ppm after corrections)
   - Omega_m = 63/200 = 0.3150 (matter fraction, 0.04 sigma from Planck)
   Getting two correct predictions from one assumption is strong evidence for physical content.

5. **Classification**: kappa = 1 is [A-STRUCTURAL within I-STRUCT-5] -- the standard Tr convention applied to the democratic bilinear principle. This is a Layer 2 identification (math convention -> physics), not a free parameter fit. Absorbed into I-STRUCT-5's absolute extension.

## Open Questions

1. **Factor-of-9 gap** (EQ-003 remaining): S_EM = 126 (generator charges) vs sum(Q^2)_coset = 14 (scalar charges). Why 126/14 = 9? Is there a structural explanation (e.g., 9 = Im_H^2)?
2. **Sigma model matching scale**: Can the matching scale where kappa = 1 holds be derived from the sigma model dynamics?
3. **IRA-04** (commutator-trace coupling form): The next structural assumption to attack. Why Tr([epsilon_i, epsilon_j]^2) specifically?

## Key Context for Next Session

The alpha derivation chain is now in its strongest state: 17 steps with 16 DERIVED/STANDARD MATH and 1 structural convention (kappa = 1). The convention choice is the standard mathematical default (unnormalized HS = Tr) and is supported by the EQ-002/EQ-003 duality (two predictions from one parameter). No conjectures remain in the chain. The IRA inventory has 8 assumptions total with 0 conjectures -- the best it has ever been. Natural next targets: IRA-04 (coupling form), LLM Challenge v3 with more models, or a new physics investigation.
