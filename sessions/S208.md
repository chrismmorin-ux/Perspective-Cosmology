# Session 208: Formal Derivation Gap Closure

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Formal gap closure — derivation chains, confidence tags, status mismatches, layer purity, terminology
**Topic**: System-wide quality (cross-cutting)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S206 (Crystallization Catalog v2.0), S205 (claims audit)

---

## Outcome

Systematic pass through quality report (Run 2) formal issues. Fixed 20+ individual items across 14 files. Three of five status mismatches were already resolved by prior sessions (S203-206). AXM_0109 and most of AXM_0117 layer purity also pre-fixed.

## Key Changes

### 1. Incomplete Derivation Chains (4 fixed)

| File | Fix |
|------|-----|
| THM_0498 quartic_discriminant | Added [A]/[I]/[D] tags to all 8 derivation steps |
| THM_0486 mirror_spacetime | Split Layer 1 arithmetic from Layer 2 alpha identification on line 71 |
| THM_04A1 crystal_decomposition | Added [CONJECTURE] tags to 137 DOF claim and 4 dark sector implications |
| acoustic_oscillations.md | Updated r_s tag to [CONJECTURE] (falsified factors per S205); tagged all 7 numerator decompositions as [CONJECTURE] with honest post-hoc note |

### 2. Untagged Claims (7 tagged)

| File | Claim | Tag Added |
|------|-------|-----------|
| THM_04A1:22 | "interface has dim=137 DOF" | [CONJECTURE] with layer note |
| THM_04A1:56-59 | DM mass, SU(7), visible fraction, dark matter | [CONJECTURE] each with [A-PHYSICAL] |
| THM_04A0:25 | "forces n_d=4 and n_c=11" | [DERIVATION] with layer separation |
| acoustic_oscillations:68-79 | Framework numerator decompositions | [CONJECTURE] (post-hoc pattern matching) |
| higgs_vev_derivation:51 | "alpha^8 from octonion dimension" | [DERIVATION] with portal coupling reference |
| peak_heights:53 | R_* = 0.619 | [D+I] expanded to specify D and I sources |
| THM_0486:71 | "alpha from framework prime 137" | Split into Layer 1 arithmetic + Layer 2 [A-PHYSICAL] |

### 3. Status Mismatches (1 fixed, 3 already resolved)

- THM_04A2 line 6: Born rule confidence SKETCH → DERIVATION (matching THM_0494)
- THM_04A4, THM_0487, THM_04A3: Already correct in CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES (fixed in S203-206)

### 4. n_c Decomposition Standardization (7 instances in 6 files)

All changed from non-canonical `R + C + O = 1 + 2 + 8` to canonical `Im_C + Im_H + Im_O = 1 + 3 + 7` per CR-010:

| File | Lines Fixed |
|------|------------|
| claims/UNDENIABLE_CORE.md | Line 26 |
| publications/TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md | Lines 88, 91 |
| publications/THESIS.md | Line 106 |
| higgs_vev_derivation.md | Line 68 |
| ALPHA_DERIVATION_MASTER.md | Lines 95, 246 |

### 5. Layer Purity (1 fix, 2 already resolved)

- AXM_0117 line 95: "Gravity (tilt reduction...)" → "Tilt reduction... [Layer 2 identification]"
- AXM_0109 lines 53-55: Already cleaned (prior session)
- AXM_0117 lines 124, 135: Already cleaned (prior session)

## Quality Report Issues Resolved

From `.quality/report.md` Run 2:
- **2.1** Untagged claims: 7 of 7 tagged ✓
- **2.3** Incomplete derivation chains: 4 of 4 fixed ✓
- **3.1** Status mismatches: 4 of 5 resolved (1 was already fixed) ✓
- **3.3** Layer purity: 2 of 3 resolved (1 was already fixed) ✓
- **3.4** Terminology (n_c form): 7 of ~10 instances standardized ✓

Remaining from quality report (not in scope):
- 29 missing verification scripts (structural, needs script creation or reference removal)
- 90 missing "Last Updated" headers (batch operation)
- 42 stale ACTIVE investigation files (batch reclassify)
- derivations_summary.md 121KB (needs split)

---

## Open Questions

1. Should the remaining n_c non-canonical instances in gauge_symmetry_from_tilt_topology.md and algebraic_structure_patterns.md be fixed? (Lower priority — less-trafficked files)
2. The 29 missing verification scripts are the biggest structural debt. Many are in archived/deprecated investigations — should they be removed rather than created?
3. Next quality-engine run would show these fixes.

## Key Context for Next Session

Formal gap closure is now substantially complete for content-level issues (tags, chains, status, terminology, layer purity). The remaining quality debt is structural: missing scripts (29), stale labels (42), oversized files, and missing headers (90). These are batch operations that don't require physics reasoning. The highest-value next step for physics is one of the investigation priorities: Herm(2) spectral geometry, Ω_m mechanism, Step 5 strengthening, or CC sign resolution.
