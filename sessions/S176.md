# Session 176 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Documentation audit — Phases 0-2 (deprecation, quick fixes, falsification registry)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S175 (EWSB: Higgs from epsilon_di)
**Next**: S177+ (Phase 3: derivations_summary update, Phase 4: divergence_registry, Phase 5: CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES)

---

## Outcome

Comprehensive documentation audit of S143-S175 work. Deprecated stale MASTER_CLAIMS.md, fixed 4 quick documentation gaps, and rebuilt FALSIFICATION_REGISTRY.md from 12 entries to 40 entries with priority tiers and cross-references.

## Key Findings

1. **Audit scope**: 4 parallel agents inventoried 117 core files, 4 topic files, 142 investigation files, and 6 registry tracking files. Main gaps: MASTER_CLAIMS 73 sessions behind, FALSIFICATION_REGISTRY only 12 entries, derivations_summary stale from S142, 3 missing session files.

2. **MASTER_CLAIMS deprecated**: Functionally superseded by `CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md` + `derivations_summary.md`. Archived to `archive/deprecated/MASTER_CLAIMS_S102.md`.

3. **Phase 1 quick fixes**: (a) Added `tilt_gradient_kinetic_term.md` to `_INDEX.md` (gauge count 11 to 12), (b) Created session stubs S158, S161, S162 from ACTIVE_SESSIONS handoff notes, (c) Added review timestamp to `assumptions_registry.md`.

4. **Phase 2 — Falsification Registry rebuilt**: Expanded from 12 entries to 40 active entries organized into 7 sections: numerical predictions (14), inflationary (3), dark matter (4), neutrino (4), CMB blind (7), structural (6), QCD (2). Added 3-tier priority system (A: near-term decisive, B: precision improvement, C: long-term). Added 5 already-falsified entries. Cross-referenced with BLIND_PREDICTIONS.md, CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md, FALSIFIED.md.

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sessions/S158.md` | Retroactive stub (GUT trace + crystallization) |
| `sessions/S161.md` | Retroactive stub (collider planning) |
| `sessions/S162.md` | Retroactive stub (session gap documented) |
| `archive/deprecated/MASTER_CLAIMS_S102.md` | MASTER_CLAIMS backup |

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `registry/MASTER_CLAIMS.md` | Deprecation notice added |
| `framework/investigations/_INDEX.md` | Added missing entry, updated count and timestamp |
| `registry/assumptions_registry.md` | Added review timestamp |
| `registry/FALSIFICATION_REGISTRY.md` | Complete rewrite (12 to 40 entries) |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | Session registered then deregistered |

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Phase 3**: `derivations_summary.md` needs S143-S175 results (~10 major categories: Casimir, multi-coupling angles, Born rule, SM gauge group, EWSB, neutrinos, QCD, single-photon tilt, democratic quartic, generalized pressure)
2. **Phase 4**: `divergence_registry.md` needs S133-S175 findings (hilltop inflation, crystallization mechanism, Born rule)
3. **Phase 5**: `CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md` needs THM_0487-04A4 and DEF_02A3-02C4
4. **Phase 6**: Core issues — THM_0497 math error, 3 downgraded SKETCH theorems, 2 PROPOSED axioms

## Key Context

This was a pure documentation session — no new physics. The framework itself is in good shape (93/117 core files CANONICAL, ~350 scripts at 90% PASS), but registry tracking files fell behind during the intensive S143-S175 physics push. Phases 1-2 addressed the most critical gaps (falsification criteria and stale references). Phases 3-5 are mechanical catch-up work suitable for a future documentation session.
