# Session 180 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Derive lambda_0 = 1/O from CW potential
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S179 (CW potential for Higgs mass, lambda_H = 125/968 conjecture)
**Next**: Derive c_beta = pi^2/6 from composite dynamics, or y_t = 1 from SO(11) fermion embedding

---

## Outcome

Investigated whether lambda_0 = 1/dim(O) = 1/8 can be derived from the Coleman-Weinberg potential. Found that the CW is CONSISTENT with lambda = 1/O but requires three independent conjectures. The key algebraic mechanism: with c_beta = pi^2/6, the pi^2 from the loop factor cancels exactly, giving lambda = N_c/24 = 1/O (because N_c * O = Im_H * dim(O) = 3*8 = 24). The (1-xi) vs (1+xi) sign tension from S179 is resolved — beta depends on xi through partial compositeness mixing, requiring c_beta(xi) = c_beta(0) * (1+xi)/(1-xi). Grade: D+ for derivation — structural arguments are suggestive but three conjectures remain.

## Key Findings

### F1 [DERIVATION]: Pi^2 cancellation gives lambda = N_c/24 = 1/O
The CW form lambda = 4 * [N_c y_t^4 / (16 pi^2)] * c_beta * (1-xi) simplifies at y_t=1, xi=0 with c_beta = pi^2/6 to:
lambda = 4 * N_c * pi^2 / (16 pi^2 * 6) = N_c/24.
Since N_c * O = 3 * 8 = 24, this gives lambda = 1/O exactly. Verified by SymPy MCP (simplify to 0).

### F2 [DERIVATION]: N_c * O = 24 identity
Im_H * dim(O) = 3 * 8 = 24. This also equals n_d! = 4! = 24, N_Gold - N_Higgs = 28 - 4 = 24, 2 * dim(SM) = 2*12 = 24. The number 24 appears throughout the framework. This identity is WHY the pi^2 cancels.

### F3 [DERIVATION]: (1-xi) vs (1+xi) sign tension resolved
The CW gives lambda = 4*beta*(1-xi). The S179 conjecture has lambda = (1/O)(1+xi). These are NOT inconsistent — beta depends on xi through the partial compositeness mixing angles. Required: c_beta(xi) = c_beta(0) * (1+xi)/(1-xi) = (pi^2/6) * 125/117. This 6.8% enhancement is physically reasonable (top becomes more composite at larger xi).

### F4 [CONJECTURE]: c_beta = pi^2/6 = zeta(2)/2
The specific form factor c_beta = pi^2/6 is needed for lambda = 1/O. This value appears naturally in one-loop CW calculations involving dilogarithms (Li_2(1) = pi^2/6) and in conformal spectral functions. It is PLAUSIBLE but not derived from the framework dynamics.

### F5 [DERIVATION]: NDA scaling argument
The NDA estimate lambda ~ 1/N with N = dim(O) = 8 directly gives lambda = 1/8. Among N = 3, 7, 8, 11, only N = 8 matches the measured quartic to within 5%. The identification N = dim(adj SU(3)) = dim(O) connects the octonionic structure to the composite coupling.

### F6 [OBSERVATION]: Rational vs irrational tension
The CW always introduces 1/(16 pi^2) factors, making lambda irrational. The S179 conjecture 125/968 is rational. This means either: (a) the conjecture is an approximation to the CW result, (b) there's a tree-level mechanism giving rational lambda, or (c) it's numerological. A tree-level composite quartic would explain the rational form but requires specific dynamics.

## Open Questions

1. **Derive c_beta = pi^2/6 from composite sector dynamics**: This is the central open problem. Need to specify the fermion embedding in SO(11) and compute the form factor from the one-resonance model.

2. **Derive y_t = 1 from SO(11) fermion embedding**: The top Yukawa is currently an input. The framework should predict y_t from the partial compositeness structure.

3. **Derive xi = n_d/n_c^2 from vacuum alignment**: The misalignment parameter needs a dynamical origin from the competition between alpha_CW and beta_CW.

4. **Rational vs irrational**: The CW gives irrational lambda. If 125/968 is exact, there must be a non-perturbative or tree-level mechanism. Investigate whether the tilt potential can give a residual tree-level quartic for the pNGBs.

5. **c_beta = Im_O/n_d = 7/4**: Among rational framework candidates, 7/4 gives the closest match to the full conjecture (lambda = 0.1286, 0.4% from measured). This is an alternative to pi^2/6 that avoids the irrational tension.

## Key Context for Next Session

The CW derivation chain for lambda = 1/O works through three steps: (1) c_beta = pi^2/6 makes the pi^2 from 1/(16 pi^2) cancel, (2) lambda = N_c/24 at xi=0, (3) N_c * O = 24 gives lambda = 1/O. The correction to the full conjecture requires c_beta to depend on xi as (1+xi)/(1-xi), which is physically motivated by partial compositeness but not derived. The honest status is D+ — three independent conjectures are needed (c_beta = pi^2/6, y_t = 1, xi = n_d/n_c^2). The most productive next step is either the fermion embedding (to derive y_t) or investigating the tree-level alternative (to explain the rational 125/968).
