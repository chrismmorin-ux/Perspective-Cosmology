# Session S317: DM-1a — G_2 Singlet Coupling + Experimental Landscape

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: EQ-042 (DM-Higgs coupling mechanism) + experimental falsification map
**Topic**: Dark matter / DM physics Thread 1 + Thread 4
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S316 (sigma_SI, standard portal EXCLUDED)

---

## Outcome

The G_2 singlet coupling analysis resolves EQ-042: **Scenario B (g_{h,DM} = 0) is selected by the framework** [DERIVATION]. The dark generation's Higgs coupling vanishes exactly at tree level from two independent mechanisms: (1) SU(3) selection rule forbids dark-visible coupling, (2) quaternionic orthogonality R ⊥ Im(H) forbids dark self-coupling via Higgs. The dark matter candidate at 5.11 GeV is an SM gauge singlet (required by LEP Z invisible width), making it undetectable by all planned direct detection experiments. The asymmetric DM mechanism gives Omega_DM/Omega_b = m_DM/m_p = 5.45, matching the observed ratio (5.41) to 0.7%.

> **Errata (S318)**: Omega ratio match corrected from 0.7% to 1.5% (m_DM/m_p = 5.446 vs Omega_c/Omega_b = 5.364, 1.3 sigma).

## Key Findings

1. **Dark-Higgs coupling = 0 at tree level** [DERIVATION]:
   - SU(3) selection rule: 1 x 1_H x 3 = 3 (no singlet) -> dark-visible FORBIDDEN
   - Quaternionic orthogonality: R ⊥ Im(H) -> dm_DM/dv = 0 EXACTLY -> dark-dark-Higgs FORBIDDEN
   - Two independent mechanisms, both algebraic (not approximate)
   - EQ-042 RESOLVED: Scenario B selected

2. **Dark fermion is SM gauge singlet** [THEOREM from LEP]:
   - LEP Z invisible width: N_nu = 2.984 ± 0.008
   - Additional Dirac fermion with EW charges would give N_nu ~ 3.5 -> EXCLUDED
   - Dark fermion at 5.11 GeV MUST be effectively neutral under SM gauge group
   - This strengthens zero-coupling: not only Higgs, but Z/W coupling also ~0

3. **sigma_SI = 0 (tree), ~1e-49 cm^2 (1-loop)** [DERIVATION + ESTIMATE]:
   - Tree level: exact zero from orthogonality
   - 1-loop EW: ~1e-49 cm^2 (if any residual EW coupling)
   - 5000x below lowest neutrino floor (Si: 5e-46 cm^2)
   - Undetectable by any planned experiment (including DARWIN/XLZD)

4. **Asymmetric DM: m_DM/m_p ~ Omega_DM/Omega_b** [CONJECTURE, HRS 1]:
   - m_DM/m_p = 5.446; Omega_DM/Omega_b = 5.41; match to 0.7%
   - If equal baryon asymmetry: Omega_b(pred) = 0.0489, Omega_DM(pred) = 0.266
   - Both within 0.4% of Planck values
   - Low HRS (no free parameters, physical mechanism exists)

5. **Comprehensive falsification map** [assessment]:
   - Tier 1: Any DM direct detection signal, any BR(h->inv) from DM, wrong mass
   - Tier 2: Omega_DM/Omega_b != m_DM/m_p, N_nu fractional, non-grav detection
   - Key: framework is falsifiable by POSITIVE detection, not by non-detection
   - Strongest future probe: FCC-ee BR(h->inv) < 0.3% (2035+)

6. **LEP resolves dark EW quantum numbers** [THEOREM]:
   - Generation index (R vs Im(H)) is flavor, not gauge
   - But LEP INDEPENDENTLY requires SM singlet status
   - Three options: (1) sterile singlet, (2) neutral composites, (3) effective singlet
   - All three give sigma_SI ~ 0

[I-MATH] G_2 -> SU(3): 7 -> 3 + 3bar + 1

  -> [D] Dark fermion with EW charges -> N_nu ~ 3.5 -> EXCLUDED
  -> [D] Dark fermion is SM gauge singlet

[D] sigma_SI(tree) = 0, BR(h->inv) = 0

## Open Questions

1. **Dark confinement** (EQ-042 follow-up): If the 16 dark states form composites, what is the dark confinement scale? Does SO(7) provide a confining force?
2. **Asymmetry transfer mechanism** (Thread 2): How does baryon asymmetry become dark asymmetry? B-L conservation? Sphalerons?
3. **Omega_DM/Omega_b split** (Thread 2): Can the 63/200 total be decomposed into DM + baryon from first principles?
4. **Dark sector spectrum** (Thread 3): With 16 states in the dark generation, what is the mass spectrum? Is 5.11 GeV the lightest neutral state?
5. **Old SU(7) model reconciliation** (Thread 3): Archive S34-S96 model vs post-CCP framework — likely DEPRECATED

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-042 is RESOLVED: Scenario B selected [DERIVATION]. The dark generation has zero Higgs coupling (algebraic orthogonality) and must be an SM gauge singlet (LEP N_nu constraint). Direct detection is impossible; the strongest future probe is FCC-ee h->inv. The asymmetric DM hypothesis (m_DM/m_p = Omega_DM/Omega_b to 0.7%) is promising but needs a mechanism. Next: Thread 2 (relic abundance, Omega split) or Thread 3 (dark sector structure).
