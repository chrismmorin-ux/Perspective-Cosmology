# Session 203: System-Wide Claims Audit and Strengthening

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Focus**: Audit and fix cross-file inconsistencies, verify numerical accuracy, address quality issues
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S202 (Phase 7 statistics)

---

## Outcome

Systematic audit of all claims across the entire system. Found and fixed 15 issues across 8 files, including one significant discovery: v/m_p was being reported at 21 ppm with an incorrect measured value when the actual precision is ~2 ppm (Tier 1 candidate).

## Key Findings

### Phase A: Cross-File Inconsistencies (7 fixes)

1. **[FIX] Tier 3 ℓ₂ formula was WRONG**: `220×19/17 = 245.9` → corrected to `220×22/9 = 537.78`. The old formula didn't even describe the second acoustic peak.
2. **[FIX] Added cross-references** for claims duplicated across tiers (ℓ₁ in Tier 1+3, n_s in Tier 2+3, BBN in Tier 2+3).
3. **[FIX] Ω_Λ/Ω_m conflict notes** added to Tier 3 entries, pointing to Tier 1 caveat about three incompatible formulas.
4. **[FIX] r_s caveat strengthened**: Both components (η*=337, c_s=3/7) are FALSIFIED (F-8, F-9). Recommendation to demote added.
5. **[FIX] cos(θ_W) caveat added**: Precision 3.75 ppm depends on m_W = 80.377 GeV. PDG 2024 shift to 80.369 → 93 ppm (Tier 2).
6. **[FIX] FALSIFIED count updated**: README said "5+" → now says "9 + 4 deprecated + 1 withdrawn".
7. **[FIX] Tier 1/2/3 last-updated dates** refreshed.

### Phase B: Numerical Verification (5 findings)

8. **[DISCOVERY] v/m_p = 11284/43 is ~2 ppm, not 21 ppm**: The measured value in Tier 2 was wrong (262.36 instead of 262.42). With correct PDG v=246.22 GeV and CODATA m_p, precision is 1.6 ppm — Tier 1 candidate pending verification script.
9. **[FIX] Tier 1 display precision**: Ξ⁰/m_d (281.55→281.5546), W/Ξ⁻ (60.816→60.8129), m_b/m_s (44.75→44.7496). Table values were rounded too aggressively to verify stated ppm.
10. **[NOTE] Koide θ and m_K/m_s**: Couldn't verify stated precisions without exact PDG mass values used in original computation. Need script cross-check.

### Phase C: Quality Report Issues (4 fixes)

11. **[FIX] ALPHA_DERIVATION_MASTER status**: ACTIVE → IN REVIEW (7 CR-041 findings pending).
12. **[FIX] 2 orphaned investigation files** added to `_INDEX.md`: `perspective_as_rigorous_SAS.md`, `cd_closure_irreducibility.md`.
13. **[FIX] 4 untagged claims** tagged: crystallization_stress CC [FALSIFIED], Lambda decrease [CONJECTURE], QCD string tension [CONJECTURE], EM channels [DERIVATION].
14. **[NOTE] THM_0497**: Quality report flagged mismatch but both files actually say CONJECTURE — no fix needed.

### Phase D: Header Updates (2 fixes)

15. **[FIX] Root CLAUDE.md**: Claims tiering table updated from S106 counts (3/~5/~45) to current (13/15/~45/9+4+1).
16. **[FIX] claims/CLAUDE.md**: Same count update.

## Scripts

No new verification scripts (audit session). v/m_p verification script needed.

## Open Questions

1. **v/m_p verification script**: Need to write `verification/sympy/v_mp_ratio.py` with exact PDG/CODATA values to confirm ~2 ppm and consider Tier 1 promotion.
2. **Koide θ and m_K/m_s precision**: Need to cross-check with existing scripts using exact lepton/kaon/strange quark masses.
3. **r_s demotion**: Should r_s be formally moved from Tier 1 to Tier 2 given F-8/F-9 falsifications? Currently has a strong caveat but remains in the table.
4. **cos θ_W monitoring**: Track PDG m_W updates — if settled at 80.369 GeV, demote to Tier 2.
5. **derivations_summary.md split**: 121 KB file needs splitting (quality report CRITICAL item not addressed this session).

## Key Context for Next Session

This was a cleanup/audit session. The main discovery is v/m_p at ~2 ppm — if confirmed by a proper verification script, it would be a 14th Tier 1 claim. The audit also revealed that 3 of the existing 13 Tier 1 claims have significant caveats (r_s, Ω_Λ/Ω_m, cos θ_W). The honest count of "robust Tier 1 claims" is more like 10 than 13.
