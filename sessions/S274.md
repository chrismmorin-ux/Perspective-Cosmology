# Session 274: Yang-Mills — Glueball Structural Derivation

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Structural argument for glueball excitation costs (continuation of S268/S271)
**Topic**: Gauge theory / Yang-Mills
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S271 (Yang-Mills deeper derivations)
**Next**: Exotic gluon cost derivation; EQ-041 (Landau coefficients); lattice monitoring for 1-+

---

## Outcome

Derived structural origins for 2 of 3 glueball excitation costs, discovered a new uniqueness theorem for n_d = 4, and made 2 testable predictions for additional glueball states. The 1-+ prediction matches Morningstar & Peardon lattice data at 0.5%. HRS reduced from 6 to 4. One script, 39/39 PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **n_d = 4 Uniqueness Theorem** [THEOREM]: The identity S_max(S_max+1)/n_d = (n_d-1)/(n_d-2), where S_max = n_d - 2 is the max 2-gluon S-wave spin, holds if and only if n_d = 4. Proof: (d-2)^2 = d gives (d-1)(d-4) = 0. In exactly 4 spacetime dimensions, the Casimir-based spin-2 excitation equals Im_H/dim_C.

2. **Additive mass formula** [DERIVATION for spin/orbital, CONJECTURE for gluon cost]: m/sqrt(sigma) = n_d + J(J+1)/n_d + dim_C * L_min + Im_H * (n_g - 2). All coefficients are DA ratios. Reproduces all 4 S271 states exactly.

3. **1-+ prediction** [CONJECTURE]: m/sqrt(sigma) = 13/2 = 6.5. Ratio to 0++ = 1.625 vs M&P lattice 1.618 (**0.5% error**). Strongest test of the formula beyond fitted states.

4. **2-+ prediction** [CONJECTURE]: m/sqrt(sigma) = 15/2 = 7.5. Ratio to 0++ = 1.875 vs M&P lattice 1.793 (4.6% error).

5. **2-gluon quantum number classification** [DERIVATION]: Bose symmetry + color singlet forces L even -> S even (0,2) and L odd -> S = 1. The 1+- state requires >= 3 gluons (proven by contradiction: P=+1 demands L even, C=-1 demands S odd, but L even forces S even).

6. **HRS reduction**: Spectrum HRS reduced from 6 (S271) to 4 (MEDIUM). Spin and parity costs individually at HRS = 2 (LOW). Exotic gluon cost remains [CONJECTURE].

## Open Questions

1. **Exotic gluon cost** (EQ-041 related): Can Im_H = N_c = 3 as the cost of a third gluon be DERIVED from SU(3) representation theory or string junction energetics? Currently [CONJECTURE].
2. **1-+ lattice precision**: Need dedicated lattice measurement of m(1-+)/m(0++) with <2% uncertainty to confirm the 1.625 prediction.
3. **L=2 states**: The formula predicts 3++ at m/sqrt(sigma) = 11 but lattice gives ~8.4 (31% too high). Formula likely breaks down for L >= 2. Why?
4. **Normalization assumption**: The spin cost J(J+1)/n_d assumes normalization by n_d. Why n_d specifically? This is [A-PHYSICAL].

## Key Context for Next Session

The n_d=4 uniqueness theorem is the session's strongest result — a pure mathematical identity that selects d=4 as the unique dimension where the spin-2 glueball Casimir equals the color-transverse ratio. The 1-+ prediction at 0.5% from lattice provides a genuine test beyond fitted states. The remaining gap is the exotic gluon cost (Im_H), which has a physical motivation (adjoint Casimir) but no derivation. Combined across S268+S271+S274: 129/129 PASS across 6 scripts.
