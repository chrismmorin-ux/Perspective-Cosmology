# Session S319: DM-3a — Dark Sector Spectrum + Asymmetry Transfer

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: Dark sector state counting from SO(11) spinor + EQ-043 asymmetry mechanism
**Topic**: Dark matter / DM physics Thread 3
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S318 (Omega split, asymmetric DM hypothesis)

---

## Outcome

The dark sector has **8 states from the SO(11) spinor decomposition, not 16** [DERIVATION]. The "16 dark states" in S317/S318 used the SO(10) decomposition (particle/antiparticle); the correct G_2 decomposition (visible/dark) gives 24 visible + 8 dark = 32. The 8 dark states split into two types: 4 Type A (SU(3) singlet within G_2 7, connected to visible) and 4 Type B (G_2 singlet, disconnected). The DM candidate is Type A right-handed (2 Weyl = 1 Dirac fermion), the only SM-singlet dark state connected to the crystal structure. Multi-component DM (2 Dirac species) is excluded by Omega_DM overclosure.

For asymmetry transfer (EQ-043): **G_2 democracy gives n_DM = n_baryon/3, NOT n_DM = n_baryon** [DERIVATION]. The 7 -> 3+3bar+1 has 1 dark direction vs 3 visible (3bar = conjugate), giving ratio 1/3 which is excluded at -66%. The n_DM = n_baryon hypothesis requires a **B-D conservation portal** [CONJECTURE]: operator O ~ (qqq)(DM)/f^2 at f ~ 1354 GeV. G_2 motivates the connection but doesn't derive the equality. EQ-043 partially resolved.

> **Errata (S320)**: Dark sector counting RETRACTED. SU(3) subset G_2 = color symmetry, not generation symmetry. 8 dark states, Type A/B classification, G_2 democracy ratio, and B-D portal all retracted. See S320, HP-013.

## Key Findings

1. **8 dark states from spinor decomposition** [DERIVATION]:
   - SO(11) -> SO(4) x SO(7): 32 -> (2,8) + (2',8)
   - G_2 c SO(7): 8 -> 7 + 1
   - SU(3) c G_2: 7 -> 3 + 3bar + 1
   - Visible (3+3bar): 24 states = 8 per generation x 3 generations
   - Dark: 8 states = 4 Type A + 4 Type B
   - **Corrects S317/S318 claim of "16 dark states"**

2. **Two dark types** [DERIVATION]:
   - Type A (4 states): SU(3) singlet within G_2 fundamental 7. Connected to visible by G_2 transformations. Left-handed (2): SU(2)_L doublet, must be > 46 GeV (LEP). Right-handed (2): SU(2)_L singlet = DM candidate at 5.11 GeV.
   - Type B (4 states): G_2 singlet from SO(7) spinor 8 -> 7+1. Disconnected from generation structure. Mass undetermined.

3. **DM = Type A right-handed** [CONJECTURE]:
   - 2 Weyl states = 1 Dirac fermion at 5.11 GeV
   - Only SM-singlet dark state coupled to crystal (det(M) formula applies)
   - Multi-component DM excluded: 2 Dirac species -> Omega_DM 2x too large
   - Type B mass undetermined (no crystal coupling for det(M) formula)

4. **G_2 democracy gives 1/3, not 1/1** [DERIVATION]:
   - 7 -> 3+3bar+1: dark gets 1 direction, visible gets 3 (3bar = conjugate)
   - n_DM/n_baryon = 1/3 -> Omega_DM/Omega_b = 1.82 (obs: 5.36) -> EXCLUDED (-66%)
   - Also tested: Im_O/Im_H = 7/3 -> EXCLUDED (+137%)
   - Only n_DM = n_baryon matches (+1.5%)

5. **Portal mechanism for n_DM = n_baryon** [CONJECTURE]:
   - Operator: O ~ (qqq)(DM)/f^2 conserving B+D
   - f = v*n_c/2 = 1354 GeV (composite scale, above sphaleron T ~ 130 GeV)
   - Each baryon created pairs with one dark particle
   - G_2 structure motivates connection but doesn't derive equality
   - eta = 1 at 1.3 sigma from Planck (eta = 0.985 for exact match)

6. **eta = 10/11 excluded** [DERIVATION]:
   - Planck already excludes at 6.4 sigma
   - eta = 1 (exact B-D conservation) is the only viable framework prediction
   - CMB-S4: 2.7 sigma tension with eta = 1 if central values unchanged

7. **Spectrum gap** [OPEN]:
   - Only m_DM = 5.11 GeV determined (Type A right-handed)
   - Type A left-handed mass: > 46 GeV (LEP) but no formula
   - Type B mass: completely undetermined
   - 8 visible states per generation (vs 16 in full SM) -> additional SO(11) reps needed

[D S317] g_{h,DM} = 0 (quaternionic orthogonality)
[D S314/S315] m_DM = m_e * (n_c-1)^n_d = 5.11 GeV
[A-IMPORT] LEP: N_nu = 2.984 +/- 0.008
  -> [D] DM must be SU(2)_L singlet

[D] G_2 democracy: n_DM/n_baryon = 1/3 (EXCLUDED by observation)
[CONJECTURE] B-D portal: n_DM = n_baryon

New assumptions: 0 new (n_DM = n_baryon already from S318)

## Open Questions

1. **Type B dark state mass** (EQ-044 candidate): G_2 singlets from SO(7) spinor have no crystal coupling. Are they massless (problematic)? Heavy? What determines their mass?
2. **EW-doublet dark state mass**: Type A left-handed has SU(2)_L charge. What mechanism makes it heavier than 46 GeV? Radiative mass from EW interactions?
3. **Spinor gap**: Only 8 of 16 SM states per generation come from spinor 32. Where do the other 8 come from? Vector representation? Additional spinors?
4. **B-D portal derivation** (EQ-043 remaining): Can B+D conservation be derived from the G_2 x SU(3) structure rather than assumed? Is there a Noether current?
5. **Dark stability**: What symmetry protects the DM candidate from decay? Is it a residual G_2 quantum number? Accidental symmetry?

## Key Context for Next Session

The dark sector spectrum is now mapped: 8 states (not 16), two types, DM = Type A right-handed (1 Dirac fermion at 5.11 GeV). The asymmetry transfer is partially resolved: G_2 alone gives the wrong ratio (1/3), but a B-D portal at f ~ 1354 GeV gives n_DM = n_baryon [CONJECTURE], matching Planck at 1.3 sigma. Three open gaps remain: (1) Type B dark state mass is undetermined, (2) the B-D portal is assumed not derived, (3) only 8/16 SM states per generation come from the spinor 32. The strongest next step is either deriving the portal from the composite sector structure, or investigating the "spinor gap" (what provides the other 8 states per generation).
