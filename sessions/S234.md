# Session 234: Crystallization Catalog Expansion -- Phase 6 Cosmological Processes

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog Phase 6: cosmological process sub-catalogs and verification
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S231 (Phase 5 astrophysical)

---

## Outcome

Phase 6 of the Crystallization Catalog expansion is complete. Four cosmological sub-catalog files created: `inflation_detailed.md` (3 processes: slow-roll inflation, reheating, primordial perturbation spectrum), `structure_formation.md` (4 processes: gravitational instability, BAO, DM halo formation, galaxy formation), `dark_sector.md` (3 processes: DM interactions, dark energy, void structure), and `cmb_detailed.md` (3 processes: primary anisotropies, secondary anisotropies, spectral distortions). One new verification script `cosmological_crystallization.py` (16/16 PASS) covering mu^2, n_s, r (both formulas), N_eff, Omega_Lambda, Omega_m, Lambda sign (S230 resolution), DM mass formula, phi_odd, l_2, Y_p, spectral running, and r_s. C1, C7, and C17 updated with sub-catalog cross-references. Catalog updated v3.5 -> v3.6 (58 scripts, 723 tests).

## Key Findings

1. **Cosmological domain has more framework content than astrophysical** [honest assessment]: Of 13 process entries across 4 files, 2 are [FRAMEWORK-DERIVED] (slow-roll inflation, primordial perturbation spectrum), 4 are [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (BAO, DM halo, DM interactions, primary CMB anisotropies), and 7 are [STANDARD-RELABELED]. This is a significant improvement over astrophysical (2/13 CONSTRAINED, 0/13 DERIVED).

2. **DM mass formula discrepancy flagged** [verification catch]: The user-stated formula m_DM = m_e * n_c^2/n_d evaluates to 15.5 MeV (= 0.511 MeV * 121/4), NOT the claimed 5.11 GeV. This is a factor of ~330 discrepancy. The formula or the claimed value needs investigation (EQ-013). Documented honestly in dark_sector.md and structure_formation.md.

3. **Lambda sign (F-10) resolution documented across cosmological files** [consistency]: S230 resolved F-10 as a sign convention error (V<0 gives Lambda>0 via Lambda = -8piGV). This is documented in dark_sector.md and the planck_cosmology.md data file is updated. The magnitude gap (~10^111) remains as the primary cosmological gap — this is the standard CC problem, not unique to the framework.

4. **r = 7/128 vs r = 7/200 ambiguity documented** [honesty]: Two competing r formulas exist in the framework. r = 7/200 = 0.035 (from C1 entry, barely within BICEP/Keck) and r = 7/128 = 0.0547 (from Im_O/(8*n_d^2), IN TENSION with BICEP/Keck r < 0.036). Both verified in the script. The ambiguity is flagged in inflation_detailed.md. CMB-S4 (~2028) will be definitive.

5. **Sub-catalog system now at 16 files, 66 process entries** [catalog expansion]: With Phase 6 complete, the sub-catalog system covers decays (9), scattering (9), bound states (10), phase transitions (12), astrophysical (13), and cosmological (13). Seven dedicated verification scripts (107/107 PASS from sub-catalog scripts alone).

## Open Questions

1. **DM mass formula discrepancy** (EQ-013): m_e * n_c^2/n_d = 15.5 MeV, not 5.11 GeV. Which is correct? What formula gives 5.11 GeV? This needs investigation before the DM mass claim can be taken seriously.
2. **r formula ambiguity**: r = 7/200 or r = 7/128? These give different predictions (0.035 vs 0.055). The 7/128 formula is in tension with BICEP/Keck. CMB-S4 will resolve.
3. **Omega_m mechanism unknown** (EQ-002): Omega_m = 63/200 matches Planck to 0.04 sigma but has no derivation mechanism. Triple-formula RED FLAG.
4. **V_0 not derived** (EQ-011): Blocks A_s prediction. BLOCKED on EQ-020 (mass scale f).
5. **Lambda magnitude gap** (~10^111): Standard CC problem. Sign resolved (S230) but magnitude wildly off. No framework mechanism.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 6 cosmological processes complete. The `cosmological/` subdirectory now has 4 files with 13 process entries. The sub-catalog system totals 16 files, 66 process entries, and 7 dedicated verification scripts (107/107 PASS). Catalog v3.6 (58 scripts, 723 tests). Cosmology is the framework's second-strongest domain after particle physics: 2/13 [FRAMEWORK-DERIVED], 4/13 [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED], 7/13 [STANDARD-RELABELED]. Key issues flagged: DM mass formula discrepancy (factor ~330), r formula ambiguity (7/200 vs 7/128), Lambda magnitude gap (~10^111).

**Recommended next**: Phase 7 (remaining planned sub-catalogs: electromagnetic decays, weak/gravitational scattering, quarkonia, atomic structure, recombination, baryogenesis, high-energy astrophysics) or return to physics investigations (EQ-002 Om_m mechanism, EQ-003 coset geometry, EQ-013 DM mass).
