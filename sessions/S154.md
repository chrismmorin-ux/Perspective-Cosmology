# Session 154 — Deep Weinberg Angle Investigation

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Focus**: Deep adversarial investigation of sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121 from S151
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S151 (per-sector tilt angles)
**Next**: S155 (Weinberg running analysis)

## Outcome

5 findings. 28 = N_Goldstone(SO(11)->SO(4)xSO(7)) — structural origin. Two-scheme consistency to 2.4%. Unique in search space. IR relation at ~89 GeV. Precision corrected to 843 ppm. 14/14 PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **Numerology check**: Searched ALL framework ratios p/q (29 values, 403 ratios in [0.01, 0.99]). ZERO matches within 843 ppm besides 28/121 itself. Formula is UNIQUE.
2. **Precision correction**: Actual error is 843 ppm (not "0.08%" as S151 rounded).
3. **Two-scheme consistency**: MS-bar: 28/121=0.23140 (843 ppm). On-shell: cos(theta_W)=171/194 -> sin^2=0.22306 (3.75 ppm). Scheme difference: 2.4% agreement.
4. **RG running**: sin^2=28/121 at exactly 89 GeV (one-loop) — M_Z to within 2%.
5. **KEY: 28 = N_Goldstone(SO(11)->SO(4)xSO(7))** = p*q = 4*7. Structural from n_c-n_d=Im_O. Also: x(1-x) form with p=4/11.

## Derivation Chain Gap

Steps 1-4 proven: division algebras -> n_d, n_c -> SO(11) breaking -> N_Goldstone = 28.
**Step 5 gap**: WHY sin^2 = N_Goldstone/n_c^2. Three candidates:
1. Coset DOF fraction
2. GUT trace formula Tr(Y^2)/Tr(T^2)
3. Crystallization angle ratio

## Open Questions

1. Derive Step 5: why sin^2(theta_W) = N_Goldstone/n_c^2?
2. Does Tr(Y^2)/Tr(T^2) for SO(11) give 28/121?
3. How does S153's 29/126 relate? → Tested in S155
