# Session 294: Planck Constant -- Volume Defect D and Chi Correction

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Planck constant: Avenue 4+6 (volume defect D + 0.95% near-miss recomputation with corrected chi)
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/constants/planck_constant_investigation.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S291 (H_2 topological correction)

---

## Outcome

Resolved Open Question 9 from S291: the Vol ~ chi near-miss comparison. The S267/S273 near-miss Vol/C(11,4) = 0.9905 (-9463 ppm) compares the real Grassmannian volume to the COMPLEX binomial coefficient C(11,4) = 330, NOT to chi(Gr+) = 20. This comparison SURVIVES the S291 correction entirely, as it never used the Euler characteristic. The zero-crossing at (k,n) ~ (n_d, n_c) remains the main structural result. New framework identities: C(11,4)/chi(Gr+) = 33/2 = Im_H*n_c/C_dim [THEOREM], D/chi(Gr+) = 9!*63 = (n_c-2)!*h^v*Im_O [THEOREM].

## Key Findings

1. **Vol/chi(Gr+) is NOT a near-miss** [THEOREM]: Vol/chi(Gr+) = 16.34, compared to chi(Gr+) = 20. This is transcendental (contains pi^14) and varies wildly across (k,n). NOT the right quantity to track.

2. **Vol/C(n,k) zero-crossing SURVIVES S291** [THEOREM]: n* = 10.994 (nearest integer: 11 = n_c), k* = 3.956 (nearest integer: 4 = n_d). Completely independent of the chi correction. Deviation from 1: -9463 ppm.

3. **C(11,4)/chi(Gr+) = 33/2 = Im_H*n_c/C_dim** [THEOREM]: Clean framework identity linking the complex binomial coefficient to the oriented real Euler characteristic.

4. **D/chi(Gr+) = 9! * 63 = (n_c-2)! * h^v * Im_O** [THEOREM]: The volume defect divided by oriented chi decomposes as |W(SU(h^v))| * h^v * Im_O.

5. **Vol/chi(Gr+) NOT universal** [OBSERVATION]: Scanned 37 Grassmannians with chi > 0. Vol/chi varies from 0.05 to 57. No pattern. Confirms Vol/C(n,k) is the structurally meaningful comparison.

## Open Questions

1. **Quaternion-Kahler quantization** (Open Q8): Can degree-4 classes with b_4 = 2 produce integer state counts? This replaces symplectic quantization (retracted S291). [OPEN, MEDIUM priority]
2. **h and Yang-Mills connection** (Avenue 3): Shared Killing form between h geometry and glueball spectrum. b_0 = n_c = 11 = codim(mu^{-1}(0)). [OPEN, LOW priority]
3. **Physical meaning of Vol/C zero-crossing**: Why does the real Grassmannian volume match the complex state count at (n_d, n_c)? Does this relate to quaternion-Kahler structure? [OPEN]

## Key Context for Next Session

The h investigation is fully clarified post-S291. The Vol ~ C(n,k) zero-crossing at (n_d, n_c) is confirmed as the main geometric result and is independent of the chi correction. Avenues 4+6 are now COMPLETE. Remaining avenues: (2+5) quaternion-Kahler quantization (needs fundamental rework from symplectic), (3) h-YM connection. The investigation has 13 scripts, ~125 tests, all PASS, status CANONICAL.
