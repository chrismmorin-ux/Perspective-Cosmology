# Session 232: Born-Rule Sector Budget Derivation (EQ-012)

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Can sector budgets {R^2, C^2, Im_H^2} be derived from the Born rule?
**Topic**: Cyclotomic pattern (EQ-012)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S226 (sum rules discovered), S216 (three-sector decomposition)

---

## Outcome

The **End_R(V) sector budget hypothesis** provides a [DERIVATION]-level mechanism for the crystal sector budget and a [CONJECTURE]-level extension for hidden/spacetime sectors.

The key finding: reinterpret the alpha correction derivation (S89) as "Born rule on End_R(V_crystal) endomorphisms." The n_d = 4 defect modes equal dim(End_R(C)) = C^2 = 4 because C = 2 is the unique integer where 2n = n^2. Extending this pattern: V_hidden = Im_H (generation structure from Cayley-Dickson) gives B_hidden = Im_H^2 = 9. V_spacetime = R (real baseline) gives B_spacetime = R^2 = 1.

**Session pass/fail**: PASS -- [DERIVATION]-level argument achieved for crystal sector (reproduces alpha derivation). Hidden sector has structural motivation. Spacetime trivially consistent.

## Key Findings

### 1. End_R(V) Sector Budget Hypothesis [DERIVATION for crystal; CONJECTURE for hidden/spacetime]

Each sector u(k) has a characteristic vector space V from the division algebra tower. The Born rule acts on End_R(V), giving B_sector = dim(V)^2 source modes.

| Sector | k | V | dim(V) | B = dim(V)^2 | Phi_6(k) | Confidence |
|--------|---|---|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Spacetime | 4 = n_d | R | 1 | 1 | 13 | Trivially consistent |
| Crystal | 11 = n_c | C | 2 | 4 | 111 | [DERIVATION] |
| Hidden | 7 = Im_O | Im_H | 3 | 9 | 43 | [CONJECTURE] |
| **Total** | | | | **14 = dim(G_2)** | | |

### 2. Crystal Sector: Equivalent to Alpha Derivation [DERIVATION]

The alpha correction (S89): "n_d = 4 defect modes couple to Phi_6(n_c) = 111 EM channels."

Reinterpretation: n_d = C^2 = dim(End_R(C)). The defect's 4 modes ARE the endomorphisms of the complex field C. This is exactly the same counting, just reframed through F = C (THM_0485).

**Critical identity**: n_d = C^2 holds because C = 2 is the UNIQUE positive integer satisfying 2n = n^2. At other Cayley-Dickson levels: dim(O) = 2*dim(H) = 8 != dim(H)^2 = 16. The coincidence is specific to C = 2.

**Derivation chain**: [A] F = C (THM_0485) -> [D] V_crystal = C -> [D] End_R(C) has dim C^2 = 4 = n_d -> [D] B_crystal = 4 (same as alpha derivation S89).

### 3. Hidden Sector: Generation Structure [CONJECTURE with motivation]

The hidden sector u(Im_O) has V = Im_H (imaginary quaternions = generation structure).

**Cayley-Dickson justification**: O = H + eH, so Im_O = Im_H + eH = 3 + 4 = 7. The Im_H = 3 subspace encodes generation structure. Under SU(3) c G_2 = Aut(O): 7 -> 1 + 3 + 3bar, with Im_H providing the fundamental 3.

**Budget**: B_hidden = dim(End_R(Im_H)) = Im_H^2 = 9. The 9 endomorphisms of R^3 (generation-pair modes) couple to the 43 EM channels in u(7).

**[A-PHYSICAL] assumption**: The generation DOF (Im_H) play the same role in the hidden sector as defect modes (n_d) play in the crystal sector. This is the new physical content beyond the alpha derivation.

### 4. Spacetime Sector: Trivially Consistent [OBSERVATION]

V_spacetime = R (real baseline from H = R + Im_H). Budget = R^2 = 1. Only one mode possible for a 1D space. This is consistent but not a meaningful test of the hypothesis.

### 5. Total Budget = dim(G_2) [MATHEMATICAL FACT]

R^2 + C^2 + Im_H^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 = dim(G_2) = dim(Aut(O)).

Also: 14 = C * Im_O = O + Im_O - 1 (from G_2/SU(3) = S^6 decomposition). This connects sector budgets to octonionic automorphisms.

### 6. n_d = C^2 Coincidence [MATHEMATICAL FACT]

The identity n_d = 4 = C^2 is UNIQUE to C = 2 (the only positive integer where 2n = n^2). This makes the crystal sector the strongest case -- the "End_R(V)" interpretation is literally equivalent to the existing alpha derivation. For general Cayley-Dickson: dim(K_{n+1}) = 2*dim(K_n), NOT dim(K_n)^2.

### 7. Uniqueness of V_sector Triple [EMPIRICAL]

The triple {R, C, Im_H} = {1, 2, 3} is the unique set of three distinct framework dimensions whose squares give {1, 4, 9} summing to 14 = dim(G_2). (R = Im_C = 1 gives a trivial duplicate, but R is preferred as the parent algebra.)

## Confidence Assessment

| Sub-claim | Confidence | Justification |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| B_crystal = C^2 = n_d = 4 | [DERIVATION] | Reproduces alpha derivation S89 |
| B_hidden = Im_H^2 = 9 | [CONJECTURE] | Cayley-Dickson motivated, [A-PHYSICAL] |
| B_spacetime = R^2 = 1 | [TRIVIAL] | Only 1 mode for 1D, not a test |
| Total = dim(G_2) = 14 | [MATHEMATICAL FACT] | Arithmetic, no derivation of WHY |
| Individual B values {18,-10,1} | [CONJECTURE] | Sum = 9 derived, distribution NOT |
| n_d = C^2 identity | [MATHEMATICAL FACT] | Unique to C = 2 |

**EQ-012 update**: Numerator sector budgets {1, 4, 9} now have a structural mechanism (End_R(V) from division algebra tower). Crystal sector fully derived. Hidden sector has motivated conjecture. Individual numerator values within hidden sector remain [CONJECTURE] with 1252 alternatives.

## Open Questions (EQ references)

1. **Individual hidden B values** (EQ-012 remaining gap): WHY is the 9 budget distributed as {18, -10, 1}? Need: specific process-level Born rule within the hidden sector.
2. **Why End_R(V)?** [A-PHYSICAL]: Why do endomorphisms of V provide the source modes? For crystal: because tilt matrix is in End(V). For hidden: needs deeper justification.
3. **Total = dim(G_2)**: Is B_total = 14 = dim(Aut(O)) structural or coincidental? 14 has many decompositions (C*Im_O, n_c+Im_H, etc.).
4. **Cross-sector channels**: The 55 inter-sector channels still don't appear in any formula.

## Key Context for Next Session

The End_R(V) sector budget hypothesis provides a MECHANISM for the {1, 4, 9} sum rules discovered in S226. The crystal sector is fully derived (reproduces alpha S89). The hidden sector has a structural argument from Cayley-Dickson but requires the [A-PHYSICAL] assumption that Im_H generation DOF drive the hidden-sector Born rule.

The remaining EQ-012 gap is now NARROWED: the budget mechanism is available; the individual B values {18, -10, 1} within the hidden sector remain unexplained. Deriving these would require understanding specific mass-generation processes at the framework level.

The n_d = C^2 coincidence (unique to C = 2) is both a strength (makes crystal derivation exact) and a weakness (raises the question of whether the End_R interpretation is post-hoc).
