# Session 216: Cyclotomic 43 — Three-Sector Structural Origin (EQ-012)

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Structural origin of Phi_6(7) = 43 denominator in mass ratio formulas
**Topic**: Cyclotomic pattern (EQ-012)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S211 (cyclotomic pattern verified, uniqueness fails), S204-S205 (claims audit)
**Parallel**: S213 (crystal viz), S215 (coset geometry), S217 (mass scale f)

## Outcome

Identified a **three-sector structural explanation** for why Phi_6 denominators appear in framework formulas. The crystal algebra u(n_c = 11) decomposes under n_c = n_d + Im_O = 4 + 7 into three sectors, each with its own EM channel count Phi_6(k). Five formulas map cleanly to sectors: alpha to full crystal, mass ratios to hidden (octonion) sector, strange/charm to spacetime sector. New finding: m_s/m_c = 1/13 = 1/Phi_6(n_d) extends the pattern to a THIRD sector. Denominators upgraded from pattern-only to structurally explained [DERIVATION for Lie algebra identity, CONJECTURE for sector assignment]. Numerators remain [CONJECTURE].

## Key Findings

### 1. Three-Sector Decomposition [DERIVATION]

The crystal algebra u(n_c) decomposes under n_c = n_d + Im_O:

| Sector | k | u(k) | Phi_6(k) | Physical role |
|--------|---|------|----------|---------------|
| Full crystal | 11 = n_c | u(11) | 111 | EM coupling (alpha) |
| Spacetime | 4 = n_d | u(4) | 13 | Heavy-light quark transitions |
| Hidden | 7 = Im_O | u(7) | 43 | Mass ratio corrections |

Phi_6(k) = k^2 - k + 1 = EM channels in u(k). This is the Lie algebra identity: total generators k^2 minus neutral (Cartan of SU(k)) k-1.

**Derivation chain**: [A] n_d = 4 (Frobenius) -> [A] n_c = 11 (crystal completeness) -> [D] Im_O = 7 -> [D] Phi_6(k) = EM channels (Lie algebra).

### 2. m_s/m_c = 1/13 = 1/Phi_6(n_d) — NEW [CONJECTURE]

Previously noted as 1/(C^2 + Im_H^2) = 1/13. This session identifies an ALTERNATIVE interpretation: 13 = Phi_6(4) = EM channels of u(n_d). This links the strange/charm mass ratio to the SPACETIME sector, extending the Phi_6 pattern from two sectors to three.

Both interpretations (sum of squares vs EM channels) give 13. The Phi_6 interpretation unifies with the other formulas.

### 3. Lie Algebra Block Decomposition [DERIVATION]

u(n_c) generators decompose into blocks:
- u(n_d) block: 16 generators (13 EM + 3 neutral)
- u(Im_O) block: 49 generators (43 EM + 6 neutral)
- Cross-sector: 56 generators (all EM-active)
- U(1) overcounting: -1

Identity: 111 = 13 + 43 + 56 - 1 = Phi_6(n_d) + Phi_6(Im_O) + 2*n_d*Im_O - 1

The 55 = 2*n_d*Im_O - 1 cross-sector channels (= C(11,2) = 55 pairs) connect the spacetime and hidden sectors.

### 4. Sector Assignment Assessment [CONJECTURE]

| Formula | Sector | Phi_6(k) | Physical justification |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------------|
| 1/alpha = 137 + 4/111 | Crystal u(11) | 111 | EM coupling probes full crystal |
| v/m_p = 262 + 18/43 | Hidden u(7) | 43 | EW/QCD mass ratio = octonion sector |
| m_mu/m_e = 207 - 10/43 | Hidden u(7) | 43 | Generation mass hierarchy = octonion sector |
| m_u/m_s = 1/43 | Hidden u(7) | 43 | Lightest quark ratio = deep non-perturbative |
| m_s/m_c = 1/13 | Spacetime u(4) | 13 | Heavy-light quark transition |

4/5 assignments have clear physical motivation. m_s/m_c using u(n_d) is less obvious.

### 5. What Does NOT Use Phi_6 [OBSERVATION]

- m_p/m_e correction: 72 = O * Im_H^2 (product, not Phi_6)
- m_b/m_t: 121 = n_c^2 (total generators, not EM channels)
- m_c/m_b: 10 = n_c - 1 (neutral channels)
- Koide theta: 99 = Im_H^2 * n_c

The Phi_6 pattern is specific to certain mass HIERARCHY ratios. Other formulas use dimensional products or total generator counts instead.

### 6. Numerator Analysis [CONJECTURE]

Numerators B = {4, 18, -10, 1} are NOT u(7) representation dimensions (those would be 1, 7, 21, 28, 35, 49). They ARE division algebra quantities:
- B = 4 = n_d (spacetime dims contributing to Born rule)
- B = 18 = C * Im_H^2 (complex * generations^2)
- B = -10 = -(C + O) (total non-H dimensions, negative)
- B = 1 = R (real dimension — simplest correction)

The mechanism operates at the division algebra level, not the Lie algebra level. No mechanism has been derived to predict which numerator appears in which formula.

### 7. Primality Pattern [MATHEMATICAL FACT]

Phi_6(k) is prime at "irreducible" division algebra dimensions {C, Im_H, H, Im_O} = {3, 7, 13, 43}. Composite at "reducible" dimensions: Phi_6(O) = 57 = 3*19, Phi_6(n_c) = 111 = 3*37. O = C*H is multiplicatively reducible; n_c = n_d + Im_O is additively reducible.

## Confidence Assessment

| Sub-claim | Old | New | Justification |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------------|
| Phi_6(k) = EM channels in u(k) | [DERIVATION] | [DERIVATION] | Lie algebra identity |
| Three denominators {111, 43, 13} from {n_c, Im_O, n_d} | [CONJECTURE] | [DERIVATION] | Direct computation from framework axioms |
| alpha uses u(n_c) | [DERIVATION] | [DERIVATION] | S89 Born rule mechanism |
| Mass ratios use u(Im_O) | — | [CONJECTURE] | Physically motivated but not axiom-derived |
| m_s/m_c uses u(n_d) | — | [CONJECTURE] | Alternative to C^2 + Im_H^2 interpretation |
| Specific formulas (262+18/43 etc) | [CONJECTURE] | [CONJECTURE] | Post-hoc, numerators unexplained |

**EQ-012 update**: Pattern PARTIALLY EXPLAINED. Denominator selection has structural origin (three-sector Lie algebra decomposition). Sector assignment physically motivated but not derived. Full formulas remain [CONJECTURE].

## Open Questions (EQ references)

1. **Mass-octonion coupling** (EQ-012 remaining gap): Can we derive from axioms that mass generation specifically involves u(Im_O)? Needs: explicit coupling of crystallization imperfection to octonion sector.
2. **Numerator mechanism**: What determines B = {4, 18, -10, 1} for each formula? Division algebra quantities but no selection rule.
3. **m_s/m_c ambiguity**: Is 13 = Phi_6(n_d) or 13 = C^2 + Im_H^2? Both valid, but the Phi_6 interpretation is more unified.
4. **Cross-sector channels**: Do the 55 = 2*n_d*Im_O - 1 inter-sector EM channels appear in any formula?

## Key Context for Next Session

The cyclotomic 43 pattern now has a THREE-SECTOR structural explanation: u(n_c) decomposes into u(n_d) + u(Im_O) + cross-terms, and each sector's Phi_6 value (111, 13, 43) appears as a denominator in different physical formulas. The Lie algebra identities are proven. What remains [CONJECTURE] is: (a) WHY mass uses the octonion sector specifically, (b) what determines the numerators, and (c) the full formulas themselves. The denominator explanation is the "quick win" part of EQ-012; the full formula derivation requires understanding mass generation at a deeper level and is likely a multi-session project.
