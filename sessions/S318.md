# Session S318: DM-2a — Omega_DM/Omega_b Split + Asymmetric Dark Matter

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: Can 63/200 be split into DM + baryon? Asymmetric DM mechanism analysis
**Topic**: Dark matter / DM physics Thread 2
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S317 (EQ-042 RESOLVED, g=0, asymmetric DM hypothesis)

## Outcome

The Omega_DM/Omega_b split does NOT come from algebraically partitioning the 63 structure generators. No framework-meaningful decomposition of 63 gives the observed ~5.4:1 ratio (su(4)/su(7) = 15/48 gives 3.2, wrong direction). Instead, **TWO independent framework predictions combine** with asymmetric DM to predict **THREE cosmological observables** to sub-percent:

| Observable | Predicted | Observed | Dev |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----|
| Omega_m | 0.3150 | 0.3138 | +0.39% |
| Omega_b | 0.04887 | 0.04930 | -0.88% |
| Omega_DM | 0.26613 | 0.26447 | +0.63% |

Thermal freeze-out is EXCLUDED by ~10^8 overproduction (g=0). Asymmetric DM is the ONLY viable mechanism, and g=0 helps: no symmetric component to remove.

**Precision correction**: S317 claimed 0.7% ratio match using rounded Planck values. Precise Planck 2018: m_DM/m_p = 5.446 vs Omega_c/Omega_b = 5.364, true match = 1.5% (1.3 sigma). Still compatible, but correction noted.

## Key Findings

1. **Two inputs -> three outputs** [DERIVATION + CONJECTURE]:
   - Input 1: Omega_m = 63/200 from HS equipartition [DERIVATION, S293]
   - Input 2: m_DM/m_p = (n_c-1)^n_d * m_e/m_p = 5.446 [DERIVATION, S314/S315]
   - Hypothesis: n_DM = n_baryon (asymmetric DM) [CONJECTURE]
   - Output: Omega_b = 0.04887 (-0.88%), Omega_DM = 0.26613 (+0.63%), Omega_m = 0.315 (+0.39%)
   - Zero free parameters

2. **No algebraic split of 63** [THEOREM by exhaustive search]:
   - su(4)+su(7) = 15+48: ratio 3.2 (wrong)
   - su(6)+u(1)+Hom decomposition: ratio 4.25 (wrong)
   - Best integer split 53+10: ratio 5.3, but 53/10 have no framework meaning
   - Conclusion: split comes from mass ratio, not generator partition

3. **Thermal freeze-out EXCLUDED** [DERIVATION]:
   - g = 0 (SM singlet) -> sigma_ann = 0 -> overproduction by ~10^8
   - Even loop-level sigma ~ 1e-49 cm^2 overproduces by ~3x10^13
   - DM was NEVER in thermal equilibrium -> no symmetric component
   - Asymmetric DM is the ONLY viable relic mechanism

4. **S317 precision correction** [CORRECTION]:
   - S317 used Omega_DM=0.265, Omega_b=0.049 (rounded) -> ratio=5.41 -> 0.7% match
   - Planck 2018 precise: Omega_c h^2/Omega_b h^2 = 0.1200/0.02237 = 5.364
   - True match: (5.446-5.364)/5.364 = 1.5% (1.3 sigma)
   - Transfer efficiency for exact match: eta = 0.985 (within measurement error)

5. **Asymmetry transfer mechanism** [CONJECTURE]:
   - G_2 unifies visible (3+3bar) and dark (1) in same representation
   - Crystal fermion number N_f conserved by G_2 -> distributes equally
   - Portal operator O ~ (qqq)(DM)/f^2 at f ~ 1.35 TeV
   - f > T_sph (130 GeV) -> portal active during baryogenesis
   - g = 0 is BETTER than standard asymmetric DM: no annihilation needed

6. **Pair counting not quantitative** [ANALYSIS]:
   - 6 light + 21 dark + 28 twilight = 55 total pairs
   - Dark/Light = 3.5 (too low)
   - f = 10/11 gives ratio 5.44 (1.3% match) but coincidental
   - Pair counting suggestive but not a derivation

7. **CMB-S4 decisive** [PREDICTION]:
   - CMB-S4 (~2028): ratio uncertainty ~0.57% (from ~1.2%)
   - If central values unchanged: 2.7 sigma tension
   - Would distinguish eta=1 from eta=0.985

## Derivation Chain

```
[A-AXIOM] CCP -> n_c=11, n_d=4 [DERIVED]
[DERIVATION S293] HS equipartition -> Omega_m = 63/200 = 0.315
  Conditioned on I-STRUCT-5 [A-PHYSICAL]
[DERIVATION S314/S315] det(M) on End(R^n_d) -> m_DM = m_e * (n_c-1)^n_d = 5.11 GeV
[A-IMPORT] m_p = 938.272 MeV (CODATA 2022)
[DERIVATION S317] g_{h,DM} = 0 -> thermal freeze-out EXCLUDED
[CONJECTURE] Asymmetric DM: n_DM = n_baryon
  Structural support: G_2 representation unifies visible + dark
  -> [D] Omega_b = 63/(200*(1+m_DM/m_p)) = 0.04887
  -> [D] Omega_DM = 63*m_DM/(200*m_p*(1+m_DM/m_p)) = 0.26613
```

New assumptions: 1 [CONJECTURE] (asymmetric DM: n_DM = n_baryon)

## Open Questions

1. **Asymmetry transfer mechanism detail** (EQ-043): How exactly does G_2 crystal fermion number map to baryon number? Is the portal operator (qqq)(DM)/f^2 the right form? What determines eta (transfer efficiency)?
2. **CMB-S4 test**: If central values unchanged, 2.7 sigma tension with eta=1. Would indicate partial transfer (eta~0.985) or additional dark states.
3. **Dark sector spectrum**: With 16 dark states from G_2 branching, is 5.11 GeV the lightest? Could heavier dark states contribute to Omega_DM?
4. **m_p dependence**: The prediction depends on m_p [A-IMPORT]. The framework gives m_p/m_e with C=43/7 (0.22%, S282) — if that's used instead, is the chain fully derived?

## Key Context for Next Session

The DM/baryon split is resolved: it comes from the mass ratio (m_DM/m_p = 5.446), not from partitioning the 63 generators. Two framework numbers predict three cosmological observables to <1% with the asymmetric DM hypothesis. Thermal freeze-out is excluded by 10^8; asymmetric DM is forced by g=0. The new [CONJECTURE] is n_DM = n_baryon, supported by G_2 structure but needing the asymmetry transfer mechanism formalized. CMB-S4 (~2028) is decisive: would probe the 1.5% discrepancy at 2.7 sigma. Next: Thread 3 (dark sector spectrum) or formalize the asymmetry transfer.
