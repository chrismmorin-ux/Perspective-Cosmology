# Session 238: Weinberg Sum Rules from Crystallization Dynamics

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Derive I-STRUCT-5 from crystallization dynamics via Weinberg sum rules
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S233 (Step 6 adoption + deeper derivation search)

---

## Outcome

**Conditional theorem [DERIVATION + I-QFT + C3]**: Full compositeness (from axioms) + Weinberg sum rules (standard QFT) + Schur's lemma (S224) conditionally derive I-STRUCT-5. The gap narrows from [A-PHYSICAL] (opaque physical assumption) to [CONJECTURE: spectral convergence C3] (specific mathematical condition satisfied by all known SSB examples). WSR explain WHY democratic counting beats Dynkin: non-perturbative spectral reshuffling with factor n_d = 4.

## Key Findings

1. **Full compositeness from axioms** [DERIVATION]: AXM_0109-0117 define crystal structure, HS metric, and tilt dynamics but contain NO elementary gauge field input. Therefore gauge fields are fully composite (no elementary component). In composite Higgs notation: g_el → ∞, so 1/g² = 1/g_comp² entirely.

2. **Conditional theorem** [DERIVATION + I-QFT + C3]: IF crystallization dynamics satisfies (C1) symmetry breaking SO(11)→SO(4)×SO(7) [SATISFIED from AXM_0117], (C2) unitary quantization [STANDARD from I-QFT], (C3) WSR spectral convergence [CONJECTURE], THEN 1/α₂ = 28, 1/α₃ = 8, sin²θ_W = 28/121, α₃/α₂ = 7/2.

3. **WSR explain democratic vs Dynkin** [DERIVATION + I-QFT]: Perturbative one-loop gives Dynkin-weighted sums (T_SU2 = T_SU3 = 22, wrong). Non-perturbative WSR force spectral integral to equal sigma model metric (democratic, from Schur's lemma). Reshuffling factor N_coset/T_Dynkin = 28/7 = n_d = 4 for SU(2)_L, because T_fund = 1 (S222).

4. **Gap narrowed**: I-STRUCT-5 moves from **[A-PHYSICAL]** to **[DERIVATION + I-QFT + C3]** where C3 (spectral convergence) is the sole remaining [CONJECTURE]. C3 requires ∫ρ(s)ds < ∞ and ∫sρ(s)ds < ∞ — plausible for AXM_0117's quartic potential with mass gap and derivative Goldstone interactions, but not proven from axioms alone.

5. **C3 assessment**: WSR1 (∫ρ(s)ds) convergent because derivative couplings give ρ(s) ~ 1/s² at large s. WSR2 (∫sρ(s)ds) marginal (logarithmic), same situation as QCD where it holds via OPE. Status: [CONJECTURE — plausible, unproven].

## Open Questions

1. **C3 proof** (EQ-007 sub-question): Can spectral convergence of crystallization dynamics be proven from AXM_0117 alone? Would require OPE-like analysis of the tilt field spectral function. This is the sole remaining gap.
2. **Topic completeness**: With I-STRUCT-5 conditionally derived, the Weinberg angle topic is essentially complete. The remaining C3 gap is a standard QFT question (spectral convergence of SSB), not a framework-specific mystery.

## Key Context for Next Session

The Weinberg angle derivation chain is now: V=R^11 [THEOREM] → n_d=4 [THEOREM] → End(V)=121, Gr(4,11)=28 [THEOREM] → Schur's lemma democratic metric [DERIVATION] → full compositeness [DERIVATION from axioms] → WSR force 1/g²=sigma model metric [I-QFT] → spectral convergence [CONJECTURE C3] → sin²θ_W = 28/121. The gap is one specific mathematical conjecture (C3) that is satisfied in every known example of SSB. This is a significant improvement from the previous [A-PHYSICAL] gap, which had no clear path to derivation.
