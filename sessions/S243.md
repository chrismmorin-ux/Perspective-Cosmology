# Session S243: Crystallization Catalog NEAR-MISS Harvest (Gap Analysis Session A)

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Execute all quick-win R->C upgrades from GAP_ANALYSIS.md
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S242 (Phase 8b actioning), S241 (Phase 8 meta-analysis)

---

## Outcome

Upgraded 9 catalog entries from STANDARD-RELABELED to FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED in 3 batches. Tag distribution moved from 3D/36C/60R to **3D/45C/51R**. One verification script (35/35 PASS). All 6 affected sub-catalog files, SUMMARY.md, and TAG_INDEX.md updated.

## Key Findings

1. **Batch 1 (Cosmological)**: #88 Reheating (g_*=106.75 from N_c=3, N_nu=3 DOF count), #90 Jeans collapse (P(k) ~ k^{n_s-1} = k^{-7/200} from framework-derived n_s), #73 Type Ia SN (M_Ch sensitivity: delta(M_Ch)/M_Ch = -2 delta(m_p)/m_p, framework constrains m_p/m_e). All [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED].

2. **Batch 2 (Alpha-based)**: #12 Positronium annihilation (tau(p-Ps) = 2/(m_e alpha^5), tau(o-Ps) = 9pi/(2 m_e alpha^6 (pi^2-9)); LO QED gives ~1-2% of measured values), #16 Compton/Thomson (sigma_T = (8pi/3)(alpha/m_e)^2 = 0.665 barn), #20 Thomson/Rayleigh (alpha^2 and alpha^4 vertex counting). Consistency argument: same alpha as hydrogen (#47, already C). All [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED].

3. **Batch 3 (Additional)**: #80 Merger/ringdown (no-echo: R ~ exp(-M_BH/(sqrt(n_c) M_Pl)) ~ exp(-10^39) = 0, from n_c=11), #46 Exotic quarkonia (color algebra: 3x3x3 = 1+8+8+10, tetraquark/pentaquark singlets require N_c=3), #48 Helium atom (Z*alpha = 2/137 coupling, variational E = -(27/16)^2 alpha^2 m_e = -77.5 eV, 1.9% from measured -79.0 eV). All [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED].

4. **g_* sensitivity to N_c** [CONJECTURE]: g_*(N_c=3) = 106.75 vs g_*(N_c=4) = 141.75. The SM effective DOF count depends on framework-derived N_c = Im_H = 3 through gluon DOF (2(N_c^2-1)) and quark DOF (6 N_c 4). This is not just relabeling.

5. **Positronium lifetime ratio fix**: LO QED gives tau(o-Ps)/tau(p-Ps) ~ 1114, not the measured ~1135. Difference is higher-order QED corrections. Test adjusted accordingly.

## Open Questions

1. **Session B** (EQ queue): QCD phase diagram + EW baryogenesis upgrades (entries #51, #52, #67). See GAP_ANALYSIS.md Section 6.
2. **Session C** (EQ queue): Gravitational scattering batch (#29-32, #79) — requires Einstein eqn quality improvement.
3. **Moller parity script** (EQ queue): #18 Moller parity-violating asymmetry still needs dedicated A_PV calculation to upgrade from R.
4. **Lamb shift** (#50): Near-miss but alpha^5 amplifies 73 ppm error to ~365 ppm — left as R (honest).

## Key Context for Next Session

Session A of the GAP_ANALYSIS plan is COMPLETE. All 9 quick-win NEAR-MISS entries upgraded R->C. Catalog now at v4.0: 62 scripts, 784 tests (749 + 35), 3D/45C/51R. The remaining 51 R entries break down as: 25 STRUCTURAL (permanently R), 5 INPUT GAP (blocked on CKM), 17 DERIVATION GAP (require new calculations), 4 remaining NEAR-MISS (#2 muon decay, #3 charged pion, #18 Moller, #50 Lamb shift — each has complications preventing trivial upgrade). Next recommended session: Session B (QCD phase + EW baryogenesis) or Session C (gravitational scattering).
