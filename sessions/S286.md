# Session S286: CONJ-B1 Z₂ Closure + EQ-012 Casimir Constraints

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Quick wins — CONJ-B1 full resolution via FFT + EQ-012 constraint analysis
**Topic**: `framework/MATHEMATICAL_PERIODIC_TABLE.md`, `registry/EXPLORATION_QUEUE.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S285 (Yang-Mills large-N), S259 (CONJ-B1 partial, CONJ-B3 full)

## Outcome

Two near-complete items resolved:

1. **CONJ-B1 FULLY RESOLVED** [THEOREM with I-MATH: FFT] — The Z₂ gap (no cubic term) is proven by recognizing the tilt lives in Hom(R⁴, R⁷), not Sym₀(R¹¹). The FFT for orthogonal groups forces all SO(4)×SO(7) invariants to depend only on ε^Tε, which equals (-ε)^T(-ε). All invariants are even-degree. Combined with S259 (necessity, sufficiency, Thom), the quartic potential is fully derived.

2. **EQ-012 ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE** [CONJECTURE with structural support] — C3=129 is NOT a Casimir sum (direct=192, crossed=48). No rep-theoretic derivation found for C3 or C4. However, 129 = Im_H × Φ₆(Im_O) = 3 × 43 has deep cyclotomic structure connecting to m_p/m_e (S282). The 4-constraint system uniquely determines w = {1, 6, -2}.

**IRA count: 10 → 9** (IRA-03 moved to Resolved table).

## Key Findings

1. **[THEOREM] Z₂ from rectangular matrix structure**: ε ∈ Hom(R⁴, R⁷) is a 4×7 matrix. ε³ is not even defined (dimension mismatch). FFT: invariant ring generated by Tr((εε^T)^k), k=1,...,4 — all even degree. [I-MATH: Weyl, Procesi]

2. **[THEOREM] Previous script used wrong representation**: `conj_b1_invariant_ring.py` embedded ε in Sym₀(R¹¹) where Tr(ε³) ≠ 0. The intrinsic Hom(R⁴,R⁷) representation has no such invariant. The two representations have different invariant structures because the embedding breaks the rectangular structure.

3. **[NEGATIVE] C3=129 not from Casimirs**: Direct sum Σ dim_l C₂(l)² = 192 ≠ 129. Crossed sum = 48. No rep-theoretic identity found.

4. **[FINDING] Cyclotomic Φ₆ unifies EQ-012 and m_p/m_e**: 129 = 3 × 43 = Im_H × Φ₆(Im_O). Same Φ₆(7) = 43 appears as m_p/m_e coefficient C = 43/7 (S282). Also: 129 = n_c² + dim(O) = 137 - 8.

5. **[FINDING] F=129 is the second integer-solution value**: The constraint C1+C2+C3 yields integer weights only for F = 9, 129, 489, 1089, ... (k = 0, 3, 6, 9, ...). F=129 is the first non-trivial value.

## Open Questions

1. **(EQ-012)**: Is there a deeper reason 129 = Im_H × Φ₆(Im_O)? The cyclotomic connection to m_p/m_e suggests a unifying principle, but none found.
2. **IRA-04**: With IRA-03 resolved, is the commutator-trace coupling form Tr([ε_i, ε_j]²) now the most accessible remaining structural assumption?
3. **CONJ-A1** (spectral convergence): Still the highest-impact open conjecture. No progress this session.

## Key Context for Next Session

CONJ-B1 is fully resolved via the FFT on rectangular matrices. The key insight is that the tilt lives in Hom(R⁴,R⁷), not Sym₀(R¹¹) — in the intrinsic representation, no odd-degree invariant exists because all generators have degree 2k. This is a clean [THEOREM with I-MATH], not an interpretive argument.

EQ-012 is essentially complete with negative result: no derivation of C3/C4 from representation theory. The cyclotomic pattern (Φ₆) connecting to m_p/m_e is suggestive but not a mechanism. Recommend closing as [CONJECTURE] unless new insight emerges.

IRA count is now **9**: 1 [CONJECTURE] + 1 [A-STRUCTURAL] + 5 [A-PHYSICAL] + 1 [A-INTERPRETATION] + 1 [A-IMPORT].
