# Session 198 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: CMB integrals: eta*, r_s derivation, d_C/r_s investigation, dashboard updates
**Topic**: CMB physics (`topics/cmb-physics.md`)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S197 (evaluation map foundations)

## Outcome

Computed the full cosmological integrals for the framework's CMB parameters. **Three major findings**: (1) eta* = 337 FALSIFIED (actual = 280 Mpc, 16.8% off), (2) r_s = 144.48 Mpc CONFIRMED via standard integral (0.03% from Planck), (3) d_C/r_s = 96 is generic LCDM, not framework-specific. Updated dashboard with falsified items and new derived quantities. Honest accounting: the r_s = 337 x 3/7 decomposition was reverse-engineered; the real derivation is via standard GR integrals with framework parameters.

## Key Findings

### 1. eta* = 337 Mpc FALSIFIED (F-8) [OBSERVATION]

The conformal distance to recombination from the cosmological integral:
```
eta* = (c/H0) int_0^{a*} da/(a^2 E(a)) = 280.40 Mpc
```
This is 16.8% below the conjectured 337 Mpc. The identification eta* = 337 = Im_H^4 + H^4 was numerological.

### 2. c_s = 3/7 FALSIFIED (F-9) [OBSERVATION]

The effective average sound speed from the integral ratio r_s/eta* = 0.515, not 3/7 = 0.429. Standard physics gives c_s(z*) = 0.454. The 3/7 value is 20% off from the integral average.

### 3. r_s = 144.48 Mpc CONFIRMED via standard integrals [DERIVATION]

Framework parameters (H0=337/5, Om_m=63/200, Om_b=567/11600, z*=33^2) fed into standard Friedmann + sound speed integrals give r_s = 144.48 Mpc, matching Planck (144.43 +/- 0.26) to 0.03%. This is genuine — no numerological decomposition needed.

### 4. l_A = 96 pi CONFIRMED by integrals [CONJECTURE — naming only]

d_C/r_s = 95.96, confirming l_A = 96 pi to 0.04%. But Planck best-fit independently gives d_C/r_s = 96.09. The ratio is H0-independent and generic to LCDM near observed parameters. 96 = O x (n_c + R) is a clean algebraic name but not a discriminating prediction.

### 5. Additional derived quantities [DERIVATION]

- r_d (drag epoch) = 147.06 Mpc (0.02% from Planck)
- theta_s = 0.01042 (0.095% from Planck)
- l_1 = 219.3 (0.34% from measured 220.0)

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Can Om_m = 63/200 and Om_b = 567/11600 be derived from framework principles?** These are the key inputs that make r_s work — currently [CONJECTURE].
2. **Can the l_2 peak (3.1% error) be improved?** The simple harmonic formula doesn't capture baryon loading effects on even peaks.
3. **What sets V_0?** Inflationary amplitude remains an open gap (G-CMB-V0).
4. **N_eff from framework?** Currently imported as 3.046.

## Key Context for Next Session

The CMB parameter story is now honest: framework parameters produce excellent r_s, r_d, l_A, theta_s through *standard GR integrals*. The previous decomposition r_s = 337 x 3/7 was numerological (compensating errors). The real question is whether the algebraic expressions for Om_m and Om_b have framework derivations, or are post-hoc pattern matches to Planck data. The dashboard has been updated with all findings including a new "Falsified" column.
