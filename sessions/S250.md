# Session 250: Crystallization Catalog Reassessment via CNH

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Focus**: Systematic norm/non-norm classification of all 99 catalog entries through CNH lens
**Topic**: CNH / crystallization catalog (continuation of S244-S248)
**Status**: COMPLETE — CNH catalog classification done, 1 upgrade, honest assessment filed
**Previous**: S248 (CNH Phase 2), S247 (Gap Analysis C)

## Outcome

Classified all 99 crystallization catalog entries by whether their primary framework quantities are Gaussian norms (crystallizable) vs non-norms (non-crystallizable) vs bridge (mixed). Found genuine organizational insight — gravity maps to norm, color maps to non-norm, EW/EM maps to bridge — but no predictive power. Upgraded #62 (Li-7) from R to C. EWSB-as-crystallization insight identified.

## Key Findings

1. **[CONJECTURE] CNH classifies catalog into three physically meaningful groups**:
   - NORM (11 entries): gravity (n_d=4), vacuum structure (xi, n_s, Omega_Lambda)
   - NON-NORM (16 entries): color physics (N_c=3), neutrino counting, cosmological matter (Omega_m)
   - BRIDGE (29 entries): EM coupling (alpha), EW mixing (sin^2 theta_W), interfacial physics
   - NONE (43 entries): STANDARD-RELABELED with no framework quantities

2. **[CONJECTURE] Gravity/Color duality is the strongest CNH correlation**:
   - ALL gravity entries use NORM quantities (n_d = 4 = dim(H), a Gaussian norm)
   - ALL color entries use NON-NORM quantities (N_c = 3 = Im(H), inert in Z[i])
   - No overlap: no pure-norm in QCD, no pure-non-norm in gravity (except #80)
   - The two sectors of H — dim(H) and Im(H) — govern the two non-abelian interactions with opposite crystallization properties

3. **[CONJECTURE] EWSB as norm-crystallization**: Entry #55 uses n_c=11 (non-norm) but through xi = 4/121 (norm/norm). The squaring 11→121 "crystallizes" the non-norm dimension. EWSB is the process by which the non-crystallizable crystal dimension becomes crystallizable through the Higgs mechanism.

4. **[DERIVATION] Li-7 upgrade**: #62 upgraded R→C. The CCF = 1/3 from S100/S244 is a genuine FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED result with verification script (lithium7_crystallization.py, 8/8 PASS). This was corrected in bbn_nucleosynthesis.md (S244) but not in SUMMARY.md — now fixed.

5. **[CONJECTURE] N_c=3 cluster dominates** (20 entries): Color physics touches more processes than any other single framework quantity. CNH interpretation: 3 being the smallest non-trivial inert prime makes color the most fundamental non-crystalline structure.

6. **HONEST ASSESSMENT**: CNH provides ORGANIZATIONAL INSIGHT but NOT PREDICTIVE POWER. It re-describes known physics in norm/non-norm language. The gravity/color distinction is genuinely non-trivial, but no new physics is predicted by the classification. No contradictions found, but absence of contradiction in a post-hoc scheme is weak evidence.

## Open Questions

1. **Can CNH predict NEW catalog entries?** (EQ-NEW candidate): The classification is post-hoc. Could it predict, e.g., that certain processes MUST use only norm quantities? This would require the CNH to constrain which framework quantities enter which processes — currently it doesn't.
2. **EWSB squaring mechanism**: Is the 11→121 crystallization through squaring a general principle? Do other non-norm dimensions "crystallize" through squaring in specific processes?
3. **Bridge entries as interfaces**: The 29 bridge entries describe cross-sector physics. Does the RATIO of bridge entries to total (~52% of D/C) have a structural meaning?
4. **#80 exception**: Merger/ringdown uses n_c=11 (non-norm) in the gravity domain. This is the only NON-NORM entry in gravity. Is this an edge case or does the no-echo prediction structurally require non-crystalline input?

## Key Context for Next Session

The CNH catalog reassessment is COMPLETE. Result: genuine organizational insight (gravity=norm, color=non-norm, EW=bridge), but no predictive power. One upgrade (#62 Li-7 R→C). The strongest finding is the gravity/color duality mapping onto norm/non-norm — this is non-trivial and connects the two non-abelian interactions through the quaternion structure (dim(H)=4 vs Im(H)=3). The EWSB-as-crystallization insight (non-norm 11→norm 121 via squaring) is new but [CONJECTURE]. The catalog is now at v4.3 (66 scripts, 852 tests, 3D/55C/41R). The CNH remains [CONJECTURE] — it organizes known physics but doesn't predict new physics.
