# Session 204: Claims Precision Audit with Verification Scripts

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Focus**: Run verification scripts for all Tier 1 claims, make tier promotion/demotion decisions
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S203 (cross-file consistency audit)

---

## Outcome

Systematic verification of all Tier 1 claims by running scripts with current PDG/CODATA values. Found 2 claims that fail the sub-10 ppm threshold, 1 that should be promoted, and 1 whose precision is illusory. Net result: 13 → 12 Tier 1 claims, with 4 caveated.

## Key Findings

### 1. v/m_p = 11284/43 CONFIRMED at 1.63 ppm — PROMOTED to Tier 1

New script `v_mp_ratio.py` (8/8 PASS):
- v (from G_F) = 246.2196 GeV, m_p = 0.93827208816 GeV
- 11284/43 = 262.4186 vs measured 262.4182 → **1.63 ppm**
- Denominator 43 = Phi_6(Im_O) = Phi_6(7), same as m_mu/m_e
- Numerator 11284 = 2² × 7 × 13 × 31 (framework meaning unclear)
- Caveat: v uncertainty (~2 ppm) comparable to claimed precision

### 2. m_B0/Σ⁻ = 97/22 DEMOTED — now 11 ppm

`tier1_baryon_meson_audit.py`:
- PDG 2024 B0 mass = 5279.72 MeV (was ~5279.66 in older PDG)
- 5279.72/1197.449 = 4.40914 vs 97/22 = 4.40909 → **11.08 ppm**
- The 0.06 MeV mass shift pushed this past the Tier 1 threshold

### 3. m_b/m_s = 179/4 DEMOTED — now 84 ppm (not 8 ppm)

`tier1_baryon_meson_audit.py`:
- With m_b = 4180 MeV, m_s = 93.4 MeV: ratio = 44.754, predicted 44.750 → **84 ppm**
- Original "8 ppm" claim likely used different central values
- BOTH quark masses have ~10% experimental uncertainty, making sub-10 ppm meaningless

### 4. Ξ⁰/m_d = 181×14/9 — precision caveat added

Central value gives 3.38 ppm, BUT d-quark mass has +0.48/-0.17 MeV uncertainty (~10%). The experimental uncertainty band is 255-292 (predicted 281.6). Sub-10 ppm precision is comparison to central value only.

### 5. Other Tier 1 claims CONFIRMED

| Claim | Script | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1/α = 137+4/111 | `alpha_enhanced_prediction.py` | 0.27 ppm, 5/5 PASS |
| m_p/m_e = 1836+11/72 | `proton_electron_best_formula.py` | 0.057 ppm, PASS |
| cos θ_W = 171/194 | `mW_mZ_97_formula.py` | 3.75 ppm, 6/6 PASS |
| W/Ξ⁻ = 139×7/16 | `tier1_baryon_meson_audit.py` | 6.35 ppm, PASS |
| Koide θ (Tier 2) | `koide_theta_best_formula.py` | 14.7 ppm |
| m_mu/m_e (Tier 2) | `lepton_mass_ratio_verification.py` | 4.07 ppm |

### 6. Script bug fixed

`lepton_mass_ratio_verification.py` summary section displayed wrong ppm for m_mu/m_e (68.5 instead of 4.07) due to variable reuse. Fixed.

## Scripts

| Script | Tests | Status | New? |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| `v_mp_ratio.py` | 8/8 | PASS | YES |
| `tier1_baryon_meson_audit.py` | 7/8 | 7 PASS, 1 FAIL (m_B0 >5ppm) | YES |
| `lepton_mass_ratio_verification.py` | — | Bug fix (display only) | EDIT |
| `alpha_enhanced_prediction.py` | 5/5 | PASS | — |

## Open Questions

1. **m_mu/m_e at 4.1 ppm**: Borderline Tier 1. Should this be promoted? Formula structure (8891/43 = 207-10/43) is less "clean" than other Tier 1 entries, but precision is better than several current Tier 1 claims.
2. **r_s demotion**: Still in Tier 1 with SEVERE caveat. Should it be formally moved to Tier 2 given both factors are falsified?
3. **Quark mass claims**: Multiple claims in Tier 2/3 use quark masses with ~10% uncertainty. Should these be systematically flagged?

## Key Context for Next Session

The Tier 1 list is now **12 claims** (down from 13): 4 EXACT, 7 sub-10 ppm, 1 exact integer. Four have caveats (r_s compensating errors, Ω_Λ triple formula, cos θ_W m_W-sensitive, Ξ⁰/m_d quark uncertainty). Honest robust count is ~8. The new v/m_p claim at 1.63 ppm shares the Phi_6(7)=43 denominator with m_mu/m_e, which is a structural signal worth investigating.
