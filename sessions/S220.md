# Session 220: QCD String Tension — Lattice Validation of 17/24 Conjecture

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: EQ-014 — lattice validation of √σ = 8m_p/17 and m_constituent/√σ = 17/24
**Topic**: QCD string tension (gauge investigations)
**Status**: DATA INSUFFICIENT — neither promoted nor falsified
**Previous**: S152 (initial QCD string tension analysis)

---

## Outcome

Literature search for modern lattice QCD string tension determinations. Found two independent post-2022 results that disagree by ~5%, making the string tension too imprecisely known to confirm or falsify the framework prediction at the <1% level. The framework value (441.5 MeV) is consistent with one determination (Knechtli 2024: 445±7 MeV, within 1σ) but in tension with the other (TUMQCD 2023: ~467 MeV).

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Knechtli et al. (2024) — √σ = 445(3)(6) MeV [Nf=2+1]

**Source**: J. Bulava, F. Knechtli, V. Koch, C. Morningstar, M. Peardon, Phys. Lett. B (2024), arXiv:2403.00754
**Method**: String-breaking energy spectrum with model Hamiltonian (7-parameter fit to static source spectrum), CLS ensembles, O(a)-improved Wilson fermions + Lüscher-Weisz gauge action
**Scale setting**: Gradient flow scale t₀ = 0.1443(7)(13) fm
**Lattice**: β = 3.55, a = 0.0633(4)(6) fm, pion masses 200-340 MeV (extrapolated to physical point)
**Weakness**: Single lattice spacing — NO continuum extrapolation

**Framework comparison**:
- √σ_framework = 8m_p/17 = 441.5 MeV
- Deviation: -0.8% (within 1σ of 445 ± 7)
- m_p/√σ = 938.3/445 = 2.109 vs framework 17/8 = 2.125 (0.76% off)
- m_constituent/√σ = 312.8/445 = 0.703 vs framework 17/24 = 0.7083 (0.75% off)

### Finding 2: TUMQCD/Brambilla et al. (2023) — √σ ≈ 467 MeV [Nf=2+1+1]

**Source**: N. Brambilla et al. (TUMQCD), Phys. Rev. D 107, 074503 (2023), arXiv:2206.03156
**Method**: Static energy from temporal Wilson line correlators at T=0, MILC HISQ ensembles
**Scale setting**: Multiple lattice spacings, continuum extrapolation performed
**Note**: Includes dynamical charm quark (2+1+1 vs 2+1 in Knechtli). No explicit error bar found in accessible literature — the value √σ = 0.467 GeV was cited by arXiv:2501.17943 (spatial string tension, PRL 2025)

**Framework comparison**:
- Deviation: -5.5% (outside plausible uncertainty)
- m_p/√σ = 938.3/467 = 2.009 vs 2.125 (5.5% off)
- The discrepancy may reflect: (a) charm quark sea effects, (b) different scale-setting input, or (c) actual tension with framework

### Finding 3: Tertiary prediction √σ/Λ_QCD = 4/3 is ambiguous

**Λ_QCD (MS-bar, Nf=3) values**:
- PDG 2024 world average: 332 ± 17 MeV (from α_s(M_Z) = 0.1180 ± 0.0009)
- CLS (arXiv:2412.10215): r₀Λ = 0.820(28), with r₀ = 0.4757(64) fm → Λ ≈ 340 MeV
- ALPHA: 336 ± 12 MeV

**Comparison**:
- With Knechtli √σ = 445 and PDG Λ = 332: ratio = 1.340 ± 0.07 → 4/3 = 1.333 within error (+0.5%)
- With Knechtli √σ = 445 and CLS Λ = 340: ratio = 1.309 (-1.8%)
- With TUMQCD √σ = 467 and PDG Λ = 332: ratio = 1.407 (+5.5%)

The large uncertainty on Λ_QCD (±5%) makes this ratio weakly constraining. The framework prediction is plausible with the PDG central value but depends sensitively on which √σ is used.

### Finding 4: Data assessment — why two determinations disagree

| Issue | Knechtli (2024) | TUMQCD (2023) |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Nf | 2+1 | 2+1+1 (includes charm) |
| Continuum limit | NO (single a) | YES |
| Method | String-breaking model Hamiltonian | Static energy (Wilson lines) |
| Ensembles | CLS (Wilson) | MILC (HISQ) |
| Scale | t₀ | r₀/r₁ |

The 5% discrepancy likely reflects a combination of: (a) charm sea effects in TUMQCD, (b) discretization artifacts in single-lattice-spacing Knechtli, (c) systematic differences in string tension extraction method. Neither result alone is definitive.

## Comparison Table

| Prediction | Framework | Knechtli 445(7) | TUMQCD ~467 | Conventional ~440 |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| √σ (MeV) | 441.5 | -0.8% ✓ | -5.5% ✗ | +0.35% ✓ |
| m_p/√σ | 17/8 = 2.125 | 2.109 (-0.8%) | 2.009 (-5.5%) | 2.133 (+0.4%) |
| m_q/√σ | 17/24 = 0.7083 | 0.703 (-0.8%) | 0.670 (-5.4%) | 0.711 (+0.4%) |
| √σ/Λ_QCD | 4/3 = 1.333 | 1.340 (+0.5%) | 1.407 (+5.5%) | 1.325 (-0.6%) |

## Pass/Fail Assessment

**Criteria** (from session brief):
- 2+ independent groups within error bars → PROMOTE
- 3σ away from modern lattice → FALSIFY
- Insufficient data → DOCUMENT

**Verdict: DOCUMENT — Data insufficient**

1. Two determinations found, but they disagree by ~5% — the string tension itself is not settled at the precision needed
2. Knechtli (2024) is consistent with framework within 1σ, but lacks continuum extrapolation
3. TUMQCD (2023) has tension with framework at 5.5%, but uses 2+1+1 flavors and has no published error bar accessible from abstracts
4. Framework prediction of 441.5 MeV sits comfortably within the full conventional range of 420-470 MeV
5. Cannot promote or falsify until 2+ groups agree at <2% precision level

**What would resolve this**:
- Knechtli et al. extending to multiple lattice spacings + continuum extrapolation (they are on CLS ensembles, so this is feasible)
- TUMQCD publishing explicit error budget on √σ
- A direct lattice calculation of the dimensionless ratio m_N/√σ (eliminates scale-setting ambiguity)
- An independent Nf=2+1 determination by a third group (BMW, RBC-UKQCD)

## Open Questions

1. **(EQ-014)**: Why do Knechtli (445) and TUMQCD (467) disagree by 5%? Is it charm sea quarks, discretization, or method? A dedicated study comparing methods on the same ensembles would clarify.
2. Has anyone computed m_N/√σ directly on the lattice as a dimensionless ratio (avoiding scale-setting)? The literature suggests m_p/√σ ≈ 2.1-2.2 as a benchmark but no precision value was found.
3. The Knechtli group will presumably extend to multiple lattice spacings — monitor for future publications.

## Key Context for Next Session

The QCD string tension framework predictions (√σ = 441.5 MeV, m_q/√σ = 17/24) remain [CONJECTURE] with HRS=5. Modern lattice data shows a 5% spread between determinations (445 vs 467 MeV), preventing confirmation or falsification. The most recent result (Knechtli 2024, 445±7 MeV) is remarkably consistent with the framework (within 1σ). The investigation should remain ARCHIVE status with a note to monitor future lattice publications. No further session work needed until new lattice data appears.
