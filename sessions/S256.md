# Session S256: Irreducible Assumptions + Mathematical Periodic Table

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Post-CCP irreducible assumption inventory; Mathematical Periodic Table of framework objects
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S255 (CCP propagation complete)
**Next**: Attack CONJ-A3 (algebraic incompatibility), then CONJ-B3 (algebraic dynamics)

---

## Outcome

Built a comprehensive reference classifying all mathematical objects in the framework's derivation chains into 10 groups, inventoried every remaining irreducible assumption post-CCP, and formulated 5 precise conjectures whose proofs would eliminate specific assumptions.

## Key Findings

1. **Post-CCP irreducible assumption inventory** [REFERENCE]: 13 remaining assumptions (5 [A-STRUCTURAL], 7 [A-PHYSICAL], 1 [A-COUPLING]) organized into 3 tiers by impact. Critical bottlenecks: A1 (gauge coupling = vacuum metric), A2 (interface = 1/alpha), A3 (independent sectors).

2. **Mathematical Periodic Table v2.0** [REFERENCE]: 10-group classification covering all ~54 objects from alpha/Weinberg/pipeline/CCP derivation chains. Groups: Units, Norms, Irreducibles, Endomorphisms, Automorphisms, Projections, Commutators, Decompositions, Sequences, Boundaries. Plus Derived Structures (Grassmannian, sigma model) and Beyond the Table (dynamics, quantum, number theory).

3. **5 precise conjectures formulated** [CONJECTURE]:
   - **CONJ-A1** (Spectral Convergence): SO(11)->SO(4)xSO(7) satisfies WSR convergence -> eliminates [A-PHYSICAL] gauge coupling gap
   - **CONJ-A2** (Gauge Kinetic Induction): 1/alpha = N_I at compositeness via one-loop -> eliminates [CONJECTURE] Step 15
   - **CONJ-A3** (Algebraic Incompatibility): quaternionic R^4 and mixed R^7 can't embed in common NDA on R^11 -> eliminates [A-STRUCTURAL] Step 5
   - **CONJ-B1** (Invariant Polynomial Truncation): CCP boundary forces exact quartic -> eliminates [A-STRUCTURAL] Mexican hat
   - **CONJ-B3** (Algebraic Dynamics): quaternionic transition iteration converges to energy minimum -> eliminates [A-PHYSICAL] energy preference

4. **Key structural insight**: The A3 question (independent sectors) can be stated as a concrete algebra problem — does Hurwitz's theorem (no NDA on R^11) combined with CCP-forced quaternionic structure on R^4 make automorphism group embedding impossible? This is checkable.

## Open Questions

1. **CONJ-A3** (EQ-NEW): Can quaternionic structure on R^4 and mixed structure on R^7 coexist in a common normed algebra on R^11? -> attack first
2. **CONJ-B3** (EQ-NEW): Does iterated quaternionic transition converge to energy minimum? -> attack second
3. **CONJ-A1** (related to EQ-003): Can spectral convergence be proven for SO(11)->SO(4)xSO(7)? -> harder, later
4. Should the periodic table become a formal DEF_ document in core/, or stay as framework reference?

## Key Context for Next Session

The Mathematical Periodic Table (`framework/MATHEMATICAL_PERIODIC_TABLE.md`) is the reference vocabulary for all assumption-attack work. The "Application to Irreducible Assumptions" section contains the 5 conjectures with precise statements, what's proven, what's missing, and difficulty estimates. Start with CONJ-A3 (most tractable: concrete algebra question about R^11 structure) and CONJ-B3 (second most tractable: fixed-point analysis of quaternionic maps). Both are SymPy-checkable.
