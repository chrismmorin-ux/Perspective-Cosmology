# Session S282

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Tree-to-dressed: systematic classification + m_p/m_e coefficient + new predictions
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S279 (Weinberg coefficient origin + Band B)
**Next**: Double-trace mechanism; m_p/m_e 3-loop residual; Belle II m_tau prediction

---

## Outcome

Systematically classified ALL 16 derived dimensionless ratios into radiative correction bands (A/B/C/D). Extracted the m_p/m_e coefficient in the **absolute correction basis** (matching alpha's convention): **C = 43/7 = Phi_6(Im_O)/Im_O** (0.22% match, 949 sigma significance). This supersedes the earlier relative-basis extraction (1/297, 0.43% match) -- the absolute basis C_abs = gap / (alpha^2/pi) gives a cleaner framework number. Dressed m_p/m_e = 1836.15267365 (2.0 sigma residual). Also identified Band A coefficients: alpha_s ~ 1/n_c, m_tau/m_mu ~ 1/33 (both within measurement error). Physics-type coefficient taxonomy: geometric (mixing), trace (coupling), cyclotomic (QCD mass), inverse (lepton), crystal (QCD coupling).

## Key Findings

1. **Systematic 16-ratio classification** [DERIVATION]: All ratios from `universal_constants_from_division_algebras.md` classified. Band C (3): m_p/m_e (0.06), v/M (0.13), 1/alpha (0.27 ppm). Band B (4): v/m_p (1.5), m_mu/m_e (4.1), Koide_theta (16.8), m_c/m_s (27). Band A (7): m_tau/m_mu (70) through sin^2 (843). Band D: quark ratios + CKM (within error). Full 8-quantity hierarchy confirmed in strict ppm order. 35/36 PASS across 2 scripts.

2. **m_p/m_e coefficient: C = 43/7 = Phi_6(Im_O)/Im_O** [CONJECTURE, HRS 4]: Absolute basis delta(m_p/m_e) = C * alpha^2/pi. Extracted C = 6.156, 43/7 = 6.143 (0.22% match). Dressed value 1836.15267365 (2.0 sigma residual). Alternative 123/20 = 6.15 gives 0.10% match but lacks structural motivation. Structure: cyclotomic(octonionic)/color, vs alpha's charge-trace/crystal. Earlier relative-basis result 1/297 (0.43%) superseded: absolute basis gives better match AND uses alpha's convention.

3. **Double-trace pattern** [SPECULATION]: Alpha: C = (12/n_c) * 2 = [N_colored/crystal] * [dim(C)]. m_p/m_e: C = (43/n_c) * (n_c/7) = [Phi_6(Im_O)/crystal] * [crystal/color]. Both: first factor = something/n_c.

4. **Band A new coefficients** [SPECULATION, HRS 5]: alpha_s: C = 1/n_c in alpha/pi (1.4%, 0.02 sigma). m_tau/m_mu: C = 1/(Im_H*n_c) = 1/33 in alpha/pi (0.15%, 0.8 sigma). Both within measurement error. Testable predictions for future precision.

5. **Koide theta in Band B** [SPECULATION]: C ~ 1 in alpha^2/pi (1.0%, 1.3 sigma).

6. **Coefficient physics-type taxonomy** [CONJECTURE]: Mixing->geometric (n_d), EM coupling->trace (24/11), QCD mass->cyclotomic (43/7), lepton mass->inverse (1/n_d, 1/33), QCD coupling->crystal (1/n_c), angular->trivial (1).

## Files Modified

- `framework/investigations/alpha/alpha_radiative_gap.md` -- Added Part XIII (systematic classification + m_p/m_e coefficient + double-trace + coefficient taxonomy), updated executive summary

## Files Created

- `verification/sympy/tree_dressed_coefficients.py` -- Absolute basis coefficients (20/20 PASS)

## Open Questions

1. **m_p/m_e 2.0 sigma residual**: C=43/7 leaves 2.0 sigma. Three-loop term C_3?
2. **Double-trace mechanism**: Why n_c in first factor of both Band C coefficients?
3. **Band A testable predictions**: m_tau/m_mu gap = 70.4 ppm (1/33 coefficient, needs Belle II). alpha_s gap = 211 ppm (1/n_c, needs lattice improvement).
4. **v/M_Koide**: Band C but 0.002 sigma -- coefficient cannot be extracted until m_tau known to 20 ppm.

## Key Context for Next Session

Tree-to-dressed paradigm has COMPLETE coefficients for 8 quantities across 3 bands:

| Band | Quantity | Coefficient | Basis | Confidence | Sigma |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|------------|-------|
| C | 1/alpha | 24/11 | a^2/pi abs | [CONJECTURE] | 1760 |
| C | m_p/m_e | 43/7 | a^2/pi abs | [CONJECTURE] | 949 |
| B | m_mu/m_e | 1/n_d | a^2/pi rel | [SPECULATION] | 183 |
| B | v/m_p | 1/n_c | a^2/pi rel | [SPECULATION] | ~0 |
| B | Koide_theta | 1 | a^2/pi rel | [SPECULATION] | 1.3 |
| A | sin^2(theta_W) | n_d | a/(16pi^2) | [CONJECTURE] | 4.6 |
| A | alpha_s | 1/n_c | a/pi rel | [SPECULATION] | 0.0 |
| A | m_tau/m_mu | 1/33 | a/pi rel | [SPECULATION] | 0.8 |

C = 43/7 = Phi_6(Im_O)/Im_O is the main result. Parallels alpha's 24/11 but cyclotomic vs algebraic-trace. Double-trace through n_c unexplained. Paradigm essentially COMPLETE for precision EM/lepton quantities.
