# Session S304: IRA-01 kappa=1 Definitional Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Is kappa=1 (standard Tr convention for HS metric) definitional/derived or genuinely irreducible?
**Topic**: `framework/IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S302 (IRA-10 resolved), S297 (CONJ-A2 partial, kappa=1 upgraded to [A-STRUCTURAL])
**Next**: New physics topic; or IRA-04 (quartic ratio, LOW impact)

---

## Outcome

**IRA-01 RESOLVED [DERIVATION]**. kappa=1 is derived, not assumed. Three converging arguments establish that the standard Tr convention on End(V) is the UNIQUE normalization consistent with the framework's axioms and principles. IRA count reduced from 5 to 4.

## Key Findings

1. **C2 propagation** [DERIVATION]: Crystal axiom C2 (orthonormality ⟨b_i, b_j⟩ = δ_ij) induces ||E_ij||^2 = 1 on End(V), where E_ij = |b_i⟩⟨b_j|. This IS the standard Tr convention. The HS metric inherits from the crystal norm — not a convention choice.

2. **Democracy across blocks** [THEOREM]: Tr/n convention gives ||E||^2 = 1/n in u(n), so u(4) generators get norm 1/4 while u(11) generators get norm 1/11. This violates I-STRUCT-5 (democratic bilinear principle). Only standard Tr gives equal norms across all blocks. Furthermore, Tr/n is ambiguous for rectangular matrices Hom(R^4, R^7) — no canonical "n" for 4x7 matrices.

3. **Full compositeness** [DERIVATION]: No bare gauge kinetic term exists (derived from axioms: all dynamics emerge from crystallization). The induced coupling IS the physical coupling. No rescaling freedom exists, so kappa = 1 by construction.

4. **S297 correction**: Omega_m = 63/200 is kappa-INDEPENDENT (it's a ratio where kappa cancels). The EQ-002/EQ-003 "duality" argument is weaker than S297 claimed — it's really about I-STRUCT-5 democracy, not kappa.

5. **Killing form excluded** [THEOREM]: Killing normalization gives 1/alpha = 2*sum(C_2(R)*N_i) = 2790, which is 20x too large. Also introduces dimension-dependent factors violating democracy.

6. **IRA count: 5 -> 4**. Remaining: IRA-04 (quartic ratio, [A-STRUCTURAL, LOW]), IRA-06 (SSB, [A-PHYSICAL, Weinberg-forced]), IRA-07 (time, [A-PHYSICAL, Weinberg-forced]), IRA-11 (|Pi| scale, [A-IMPORT]).

## Open Questions

1. **IRA-04** (EQ-NNN): Quartic ratio rho = c_4/b_4 appears genuinely irreducible. LOW impact (affects only shape mode masses). Worth investigating but not urgent.
2. **Alpha chain status**: With IRA-01 resolved, the alpha chain now has ZERO irreducible assumptions that are conjectures. The chain is: axioms -> 137 [DERIVED] -> kappa=1 [DERIVED from C2+I-STRUCT-5] -> 1/alpha = 137 + 4/111 [DERIVATION]. Only the 4/111 correction depends on [A-STRUCTURAL] content (I-STRUCT-5 for double-trace).

## Key Context for Next Session

IRA-01 (kappa=1) has been resolved as DERIVED from C2 propagation + I-STRUCT-5 democracy + full compositeness. The framework now has only 4 irreducible assumptions: 1 structural (LOW impact quartic ratio), 2 physical (Weinberg-forced SSB and time identifications), and 1 import (cosmological scale). Zero conjectures remain as assumptions. The alpha derivation chain has zero conjectural assumptions — all steps are either axiom-derived or carry the [A-STRUCTURAL] tag from I-STRUCT-5 (democratic principle, itself derived S292). Next natural directions: new physics investigations, IRA-04 (low priority), or framework propagation.
