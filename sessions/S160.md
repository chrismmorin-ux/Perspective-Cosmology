# Session 160 — 2026-01-30

**Focus**: Weinberg angle: (A) democratic counting from tilt Lagrangian, (B) scheme identification, (C) strong coupling anomaly
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S159 (S_2=29 + correction terms)

## Outcome

Completed all three tasks. Task A yielded a key NEGATIVE result: standard one-loop QFT gives Dynkin indices (sin²=1/2 or 3/8), NOT democratic counting — ruling out perturbative derivation. Task B RESOLVED the 7% discrepancy in 1/α₂ (was using wrong α scale) and identified 28/121 as sitting between MS-bar and LEP effective schemes. Task C classified the EW/strong counting difference and showed O = dim(SU(3)) is structural via G2 = Aut(O).

## Key Findings

### Finding 21 [DERIVATION]: 7% discrepancy in 1/α₂ RESOLVED
The apparent 7% gap (31.7 vs 29.6) was caused by using Thomson-limit α(0) = 1/137 instead of running α(M_Z) = 1/127.955. Corrected: 1/α₂ = (28/121) × 127.955 = 29.61 vs measured 29.587 (0.07%).

### Finding 22 [DERIVATION]: 28/121 between MS-bar and LEP effective
28/121 = 0.23140 is 800 ppm from MS-bar (0.23122) and 540 ppm from LEP effective (0.23153). Closer to LEP effective. May correspond to an intermediate scheme determined by crystallization scale.

### Finding 23 [CONJECTURE]: Two counting regimes (EW vs Strong)
EW sector (broken, perturbative) uses Goldstone fraction: sin² = 28/121. Strong sector (unbroken, confined) uses group dimension: 1/αs = O = 8. Crossover at ~5 TeV where 1/αs = 13.

### Finding 24 [DERIVATION/CONJECTURE]: O = dim(SU(3)) structural
SU(3) has dimension 8 = O because it is the subgroup of G2 = Aut(O) that fixes the complex direction. dim(G2) = 14 = 8 + 6 = O + C×Im_H.

### Task A NEGATIVE RESULT: Democratic counting not from standard one-loop
Standard one-loop Lagrangian L = (1/2)Tr(∂M ∂M) for M ∈ u(11) gives Dynkin-index-weighted gauge couplings: T_L(A) = 8, T_L(D) = 0, T_L(B) = 7, total T_L = 15. This gives sin² = 1/2 or 3/8, NOT 28/121. The coset volume fraction mechanism (geometric, non-perturbative) is the most promising remaining candidate.

## Open Questions

1. What non-perturbative mechanism produces democratic (equal-weight) mode counting? Coset volume fraction is geometric but needs dynamics.
2. What determines the precise renormalization scheme (between MS-bar and LEP effective) that 28/121 targets?
3. Why does the EW/strong crossover happen at ~5 TeV? Is there physics at this scale?
4. Can the two-regime picture be made predictive for the strong coupling correction (1/αs goes from 8 to 13)?

## Key Context for Next Session

The Weinberg angle investigation has reached a natural plateau. The main open questions (Task A mechanism, scheme, strong anomaly) are all answered or classified. The remaining gap is the coset volume fraction derivation — a non-perturbative geometric argument for why gauge couplings couple to volume fractions. This is a deep theoretical question that may require new mathematical tools (geometric measure theory on cosets, or lattice-like arguments).

The 7% discrepancy resolution (Finding 21) is a significant cleanup that makes the framework's electroweak predictions self-consistent: sin²θ_W = 28/121 at M_Z scale, with 1/α₂ = 29.61 (0.07% match) when using the correct running α.
