# Session S312

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: Physical implications of graded decomposition + G_2/SO(4) Wolf space
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S311 (graded decomposition formula 42=21+14+6+1)
**Next**: F_4 Wolf space role; deeper physical meaning of 42+28=70; new topic

## Outcome

Six structural identities connect the 42-dim graded space to the framework's Grassmannian and division algebra structure. The G_2/SO(4) Wolf space has ALL THREE topological invariants equal to division algebra dimensions: dim=8=dim_O, chi=3=Im_H, quat_dim=2=dim_C [THEOREM]. The SO(4) representation content splits into integer spin (22=2n_c) and half-integer spin (20=chi(Gr+(4,11))), and this split is SPECIFIC to Im_H=3 (unique positive root of a quadratic) [THEOREM]. The F_4 Wolf space F_4/(Sp(3)*Sp(1)) also has both invariants as framework numbers: dim=28=N_Goldstone, chi=7=Im_O [OBSERVATION].

## Key Findings

1. **42 + 28 = C(dim_O, n_d) = C(8,4) = 70** [DERIVATION]: Chain sum + Goldstones = 4th exterior power of the octonion algebra. Uses N_Goldstone = C(dim_O, 2) = dim(so(dim_O)) from CD doubling dim_O = 2*n_d.

2. **55 - 42 = Phi_6(n_d) = 13** [DERIVATION]: so(n_c) deficit equals cyclotomic polynomial at n_d. Decomposition: deficit = N_Goldstone - dim(G_2) - 1 = 28-14-1 = 13 = Im_O*dim_C - 1. Underlying identity n_d^2 - n_d + 2 = 2*Im_O holds ONLY at n_d = 1, 4 [THEOREM] (roots of (n-1)(n-4)=0).

3. **G_2/SO(4) Wolf space invariants** [THEOREM]: dim = 8 = dim_O, chi = 3 = Im_H (via |W(G_2)|/|W(SO(4))| = 12/4), quat_dim = 2 = dim_C, Betti: 1+t^4+t^8. Cells at {0, n_d, 2*n_d}. Parameterizes quaternionic subalgebras H inside O; chi=3 = "three essential subalgebras" = Im_H = three imaginary quaternion units.

4. **F_4/(Sp(3)*Sp(1)) also framework** [OBSERVATION]: dim = 28 = N_Goldstone, chi = 7 = Im_O, quat_dim = 7 = Im_O. Two of five exceptional Wolf spaces have BOTH invariants as framework numbers. The other three (E_6, E_7, E_8) do not.

5. **SO(4) content of 42-dim space** [DERIVATION]: Under SO(4) = SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R: (0,0)x1 + (1,0)x3 + (0,1)x4 + (1/2,1/2)x3 + (1/2,3/2)x1 = 1+9+12+12+8 = 42. Integer spin = 22 = 2*n_c. Half-integer = 20 = chi(Gr+(4,11)). L-R asymmetry = Im_H = 3.

6. **Integer/half-integer split unique to Im_H=3** [THEOREM]: 1 + Im_H*Im_O = 2*n_c requires 2*Im_H^2 - 5*Im_H - 3 = 0, unique positive root Im_H = 3. Another "only at these values" identity.

7. **Branching rules verified** [THEOREM/DERIVATION]: 7 -> (1/2,1/2)+(0,1) = 4+3 [octonionic decomposition]. 14 -> (1,0)+(0,1)+2*(1/2,1/2) = 6+8 [Cartan decomposition, symmetric space]. so(7) -> (1,0)+2*(0,1)+(1/2,1/2)+(1/2,3/2) = 3+6+4+8 [Lambda^2 of branching].

8. **Coset chain topology** [THEOREM]: SO(7)/G_2: dim=Im_O, chi=0. G_2/SO(4): dim=dim_O, chi=Im_H. SO(4): dim=C(n_d,2), chi=0. Only G_2/SO(4) has nonzero chi. Product of coset dims = n_d^2 * dim(so(7)) = 336.

## Open Questions

1. **F_4 Wolf space role** (EQ-new?): F_4/(Sp(3)*Sp(1)) has dim=28=N_Goldstone and chi=7=Im_O. F_4 = Aut(J_3(O)). Does the exceptional Jordan algebra J_3(O) play a role in the framework? The quaternion-Kahler structure of this space might constrain the Goldstone sector.
2. **Physical meaning of 42+28=70=C(8,4)**: The 4th exterior power of O combines the graded chain sum with the Goldstones. Is Lambda^4(O) a natural object in the framework? It would represent 4-forms on the octonion algebra.
3. **The 22/20 split**: Integer spin = 2*n_c and half-integer = chi(Gr+). Is there a physical interpretation? The half-integer content (20 dim) equals the Euler characteristic of the oriented Grassmannian, which counts fixed points of a torus action.

## Key Context for Next Session

Six structural identities from the graded decomposition: 42+28=C(8,4)=70, 55-42=Phi_6(n_d)=13, G_2/SO(4) Wolf space (dim=dim_O, chi=Im_H, qd=dim_C), F_4 Wolf space (dim=28, chi=7), SO(4) integer/half-integer split 22/20 (unique to Im_H=3), branching rules verified. 59/59 PASS (2 scripts).
