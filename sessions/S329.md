# Session S329: g_rho Derivation Attempt

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Can g_rho = n_d = 4 be derived from framework axioms?
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S326 (colored pNGB mass from CW), S268-S285 (Yang-Mills mass gap)
**Next**: EQ-027 (branching ratios), or new topic

---

## Outcome

Systematically tested 6 derivation routes for g_rho = n_d = 4 (the sole free parameter in the colored pNGB mass prediction). Found that g_rho = n_d is NOT derivable from existing framework results alone. The strongest route (End(R^{n_d}) counting) provides structural support but requires the large-N formula g = sqrt(N) with coefficient c=1, which is not justified. The conjecture has structural motivation (same End(V) counting as the alpha derivation, same n_d universality as the glueball base mass) but falls short of [DERIVATION]. It is NOT a new IRA (too narrow in scope, testable at HL-LHC).

## Key Findings

1. **Route A (YM mode counting analog)**: [NEGATIVE] No non-trivial algebraic identity analogous to 2*(d-2) = d exists for massive vector resonances. The glueball identity is unique. Best candidate (d^2 Lorentz entries -> g_rho = d) conflates gauge and physical DOF.

2. **Route B (KSRF + WSR)**: [NEGATIVE] 3 equations in 4 unknowns. System is underdetermined without knowledge of the axial-vector mass m_A. Framework glueball spectrum ratios could constrain this but speculatively.

3. **Route C/F (End(R^{n_d}) counting)**: [STRONGEST, STRUCTURAL SUPPORT] N_eff = dim(End(R^{n_d})) = n_d^2 = 16, giving g_rho = sqrt(N_eff) = n_d = 4. Uses the SAME democratic counting as N_I = n_d^2 + n_c^2 = 137 in the alpha derivation. Weakness: requires large-N scaling formula g = sqrt(N) as exact (c=1), but QCD shows c ~ 3.4, not 1.

4. **Route D (lambda_H consistency)**: [INCONCLUSIVE] Higgs mass is top-dominated. Gauge contribution is 4-30% of top for g_rho = 3-5, insufficient to pin g_rho.

5. **Route E (IRA-04 connection)**: [INDEPENDENT] g_rho and rho = c_4/b_4 enter different physical quantities (resonance mass vs. shape mode mass). No algebraic relationship found.

6. **Assessment**: g_rho = n_d remains [CONJECTURE with structural support]. Not promotable to [DERIVATION] without justifying c=1. Not a new IRA (narrow scope, falsifiable). Confidence: MEDIUM.

7. **Promotion paths**: (a) Find algebraic identity [strongest], (b) derive c=1 from framework, (c) lattice confirmation, (d) HL-LHC discovery at ~1.76 TeV.

8. **Key identity**: n_d^2 = 2^n_d = 16 (unique to d=4, S313). This means dim(End(R^{n_d})) = dim(Spin(n_d)), connecting the End counting to spinorial structure. Potentially relevant but not yet exploited.

## Open Questions

1. **n_d^2 = 2^n_d connection**: Can the identity dim(End(R^{n_d})) = dim(Spin(n_d)) provide a non-perturbative argument for g_rho = n_d that avoids large-N scaling altogether? The spinor representation might connect to the composite sector's chiral symmetry structure.
2. **HL-LHC test**: m_col = 1761 GeV (g_rho = 4) is within HL-LHC reach (~2.5 TeV). Discovery/exclusion timeline: 2028-2032.
3. **EQ-027 (branching ratios)**: Needed to sharpen the HL-LHC prediction (beta parameter).

## Key Context for Next Session

g_rho = n_d = 4 is confirmed as [CONJECTURE with structural support], NOT [DERIVATION]. The End(R^{n_d}) counting argument (Route F) is the strongest motivation: N_eff = n_d^2 -> g_rho = n_d, using the same democratic counting as the alpha derivation. The critical gap is the large-N coefficient c=1, which is a QFT import without framework justification. The IRA inventory remains at 4 (unchanged). The colored pNGB mass prediction m_col = 1761 GeV stands as a testable conjecture for HL-LHC. No new investigation files needed — this result strengthens the existing EQ-015 record.
