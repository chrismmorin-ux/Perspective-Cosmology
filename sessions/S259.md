# Session S259: Post-S258 Assumption Landscape + CONJ-B3 Resolution

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Assess remaining assumptions after S258 (CONJ-A3 proof), attack remaining conjectures
**Topic**: Mathematical Periodic Table / irreducible assumptions
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S258 (CONJ-A3 proven, CONJ-B3 partial), S256 (MPT built)

---

## Outcome

**CONJ-B3 FULLY RESOLVED**: Ergodic sampling on Gr(4,11) proven via the normal closure theorem. so(11) is simple (B_5), SO(11) has trivial center (11 odd), so the normal closure of SU(2) in SO(11) = SO(11). Combined with S258's gradient flow convergence: B3 [A-PHYSICAL] -> [DERIVED].

**Alpha chain now at 0+1**: Updated ALPHA_DERIVATION_MASTER -- CONJ-A3 (S258) eliminated the last structural assumption. Only Step 15 (interface = 1/alpha) remains as [CONJECTURE].

**CONJ-B1 investigated**: NOT provable from Layer 0 alone. Invariant ring has 10 generators; quartic uses only 3. Best route: CCP -> n_d=4 -> d=4 -> QFT power counting -> quartic marginal. Reduces B1 from [A-STRUCTURAL] to [DERIVATION with Layer 2 imports].

## Key Findings

1. **[THEOREM] CONJ-B3 Ergodicity**: The normal closure of any non-trivial subgroup of a simple group equals the full group. Since so(11) is simple (B_5) and SU(2) is non-trivial, iterated SU(2)-transitions from different perspectives generate the full SO(11) action on Gr(4,11). Concrete verification: so(2) in so(5) generates full dim 10; so(2) in so(7) generates full dim 21; so(4) in so(11) generates full dim 55. Combined with gradient flow convergence (S258 Lyapunov): B3 fully eliminated.

2. **[THEOREM] Alpha assumption count 0+1**: CONJ-A3 (S258) -> independent sectors [DERIVED]. Steps 1-14, 16-17 all [DERIVED or I-MATH]. Only Step 15 (generator count = 1/alpha) remains as [CONJECTURE]. Updated ALPHA_DERIVATION_MASTER v4.0.

3. **[INVESTIGATION] CONJ-B1 invariant ring**: SO(11) on Sym_0(R^11) has 10 algebraically independent invariant generators Tr(eps^k), k=2,...,11. Quartic potential uses 3 generators (with Z_2). Higher-order terms (degree 5-11) exist and are NOT forbidden by symmetry alone. Z_2 subtlety: -I not in SO(11) for n=11 odd. Best resolution route requires Layer 2 imports (QFT power counting in d=4).

4. **[INVESTIGATION] Hurwitz-CNH connection**: Composition algebra dims {1,2,4,8} = Gaussian norms. Non-composition dims {3,7,11} = non-norms (inert primes, all 3 mod 4). Same partition as CNH. Root: C (forced by CCP) provides the norm that distinguishes composition from non-composition structures.

5. **[DERIVATION] CONJ-B1 quartic truncation (necessity+sufficiency+Thom)**: Second approach to B1: (a) Degree < 4 cannot produce bounded SSB (degree 2 no critical point, degree 3 unbounded). (b) At quartic order, (4,7) uniquely selected (ratio 37/308 < 49/264). (c) CCP smoothness -> continuous transition -> no cubic (Landau: cubic implies first-order). (d) Thom structural stability: quartic critical points non-degenerate, higher-order terms cannot change topology. Combined with QFT route: B1 reduced from [A-STRUCTURAL] to [DERIVATION with imports].

6. **Canonical Irreducible Assumptions Inventory**: Created `framework/IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md` -- first explicit enumeration of all remaining irreducible assumptions (the "~13" from S256 was never listed). Post-S259: **10 irreducible assumptions** (down from 11 at S259-start via B3 resolution).

## Open Questions

1. **CONJ-A1 (Spectral Convergence)** (EQ-003): Can the Weinberg sum rule convergence be proven for SO(11) -> SO(4) x SO(7)? This is the hardest remaining target. Requires non-perturbative QFT. All known strong SSB examples satisfy the conditions, but no general proof exists.

2. **CONJ-A2 (Gauge Kinetic Induction)** (EQ-003 related): Is 1/alpha = N_I at the compositeness scale via one-loop induction? Has obstruction DE-009.

3. **CONJ-B1 Z_2 justification**: Can eps -> -eps symmetry be derived from Grassmannian tangent space geometry? This would eliminate the cubic term Tr(eps^3) and strengthen the quartic truncation argument.

4. **Hurwitz-CNH implications**: Does the composition = norm identification have predictive power beyond classification? Could it constrain which physical quantities should be "norm-type" vs "non-norm-type"?

## Key Context for Next Session

The framework's assumption landscape is now remarkably clean:

| Conjecture | Status post-S259 | Remaining gap |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| CONJ-A3 | **RESOLVED** (S258) | -- |
| CONJ-B3 | **RESOLVED** (S258+S259) | -- |
| CONJ-B1 | **REDUCED** (S259) | Needs Layer 2 imports (QFT power counting) |
| CONJ-A1 | OPEN (hardest) | Non-perturbative QFT spectral convergence |
| CONJ-A2 | OPEN (hardest) | One-loop induction at compositeness scale |

The alpha derivation chain has **0 structural assumptions + 1 conjecture** (Step 15). The ONLY remaining hard targets are A1 and A2, which require non-perturbative QFT. B1 is essentially resolved modulo Layer 2 imports.

The highest-ROI next targets are:
- LLM Challenge v3 (numerical formula discovery) -- still the biggest meta-question
- CONJ-A1 attack via specific spectral function analysis
- Z_2 derivation for CONJ-B1
- Or: shift to unexplored physics (neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry, dark matter mechanism)
