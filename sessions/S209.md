# Session 209: Structural Debt — Stale Labels, Hyperlinks, Derivations Split

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Structural quality debt — stale investigation reclassification, broken hyperlink audit, oversized file splitting
**Topic**: System-wide quality (cross-cutting)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S208 (Formal derivation gap closure)

---

## Outcome

Massive reclassification pass across `framework/investigations/_INDEX.md`. Approximately 56 stale ACTIVE investigation files reclassified to ARCHIVE, QUARANTINE, or CANONICAL. One status inconsistency fixed (gauge_from_division_algebras had Canonical=YES but Status=ACTIVE). Hyperlink audit of axiom_unification.md found no actual issues (quality report false positive). derivations_summary.md split already completed in a prior session.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Extremely Stale Reclassification (9 files, 100+ sessions old)

All → ARCHIVE:
- forces_as_localized_recrystallization, comparison_channels_and_running, crystal_dimension_reduction
- dark_sector_from_partiality, fermion_multiplets_from_division_algebras, mass_hierarchy_investigation
- imperfect_dimensions_and_recrystallization, pi_derivation_attempt, perspective_mutations

### 2. Moderately Stale Reclassification (~47 files across 10 clusters)

**Alpha** (7 → ARCHIVE): alpha_formula_derivations, alpha_prime_attractor_enhanced, alpha_dimensionless_geometry, composite_gauge_field_analysis, alpha_mechanism_exploration, tilt_alpha_connection, alpha_crystal_interface, tilt_matrix_alpha_derivation

**Cosmology** (7 → ARCHIVE, 1 → QUARANTINE): cmb_crystallization_boundary, cosmological_crystallization_sequence, early_universe_crystallization, lithium7_problem_solution, primordial_mechanisms, continuous_visibility_model, cmb_physics_status; crystallization_stress_cosmology → QUARANTINE (per S199)

**Dark matter** (4 → ARCHIVE): dark_matter_crystallization, dark_matter_mass_derivation, dark_matter_phenomenology, dark_sections_and_pi_formula

**Primes** (10 → ARCHIVE): BREAKTHROUGH_primes_physics_unification, prime_emergence_from_perspective_axioms, prime_attractor_physical_mapping, prime_attractor_selection_mechanism, prime_crystallization_attractors, primes_and_recrystallization_unified, non_framework_primes, correction_terms_unified, session_125_cosmological_primes, session_126_density_primes

**Spacetime** (6 → ARCHIVE): black_hole_entropy_derivation, dimension_emergence, gravity_as_orthogonality_reduction, points_emergence, time_constraint, white_holes_as_nucleation

**Constants** (6 → ARCHIVE): weinberg_prime_attractor, planck_constant_investigation, planck_scale_and_big_numbers, master_formula_search, intermediate_gamma, intermediate_gamma_analysis

**Crystallization** (4 → ARCHIVE): crystallization_rigorous, crystal_structure, orthogonality_and_crystal, scheme_selection_principle

**Gauge** (3 → ARCHIVE): tilt_energy_functional, asymptotic_safety_connection, field_content_from_orthogonality

**Particles** (4 → ARCHIVE): generation_structure, mass_as_imperfection_cost, baryon_number_derivation, strong_cp_problem

**Quantum** (2 → ARCHIVE): set_theory_and_quantum_connection, schrodinger_derivation

**Meta** (9 → ARCHIVE): unified_emergence_from_perspective, unified_foundations_set_theory_forces_qm, penrose_diosi_comparison, meta_cosmology, content_C, invertibility_investigation, value_space_V, U_tuple_status, axiom_unification

### 3. Status Inconsistency Fix (1 file)

- gauge_from_division_algebras.md: ACTIVE → CANONICAL (had Canonical=YES but Status=ACTIVE)

### 4. Hyperlink Audit (False Positive)

- Quality report flagged 5 "broken" hyperlinks in axiom_unification.md
- Investigation showed paths use `../../../` (3 levels up), which correctly resolves to repo root
- All 5 target files verified to exist — no fix needed

### 5. derivations_summary.md Split (Already Done)

- File already reduced to 35-line lightweight index
- Content lives in 6 domain files under `registry/derivations/`
- No work needed this session

---

### 6. n_c Decomposition Standardization (7 instances in 4 files)

Remaining non-canonical `R+C+O = 1+2+8` forms standardized to canonical `Im_C+Im_H+Im_O = 1+3+7` per CR-010. Completes work started in S208.

| File | Instances Fixed |
|------|----------------|
| THEORY_STRUCTURE.md | 2 (lines 147, 409) |
| alpha/alpha_prime_attractor_enhanced.md | 1 (line 48) |
| gauge/gauge_from_division_algebras.md | 1 (line 224) |
| framework/PRIME_PHYSICAL_CATALOG.md | 3 (lines 91, 403, 596) |

### 7. File-Level Status Headers (40 files)

In addition to _INDEX.md status changes, the actual investigation files' `**Status**:` headers were edited to match. 40 files changed from ACTIVE/ACTIVE-DEVELOPMENT to ARCHIVE with stale-since notes.

---

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| framework/investigations/_INDEX.md | ~56 status changes (ACTIVE → ARCHIVE/QUARANTINE/CANONICAL) |
| 40 investigation files | Status header: ACTIVE → ARCHIVE (with stale-since notes) |
| THEORY_STRUCTURE.md | n_c canonical form (2 instances) |
| alpha/alpha_prime_attractor_enhanced.md | n_c canonical form |
| gauge/gauge_from_division_algebras.md | n_c canonical form |
| framework/PRIME_PHYSICAL_CATALOG.md | n_c canonical form (3 instances) |
| registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md | Session registration/deregistration |

## Quality Report Issues Addressed

From `.quality/report.md` Run 2:
- **1.2** Stale ACTIVE investigations: ~56 of ~60 reclassified (INDEX + file headers)
- **1.3** Broken hyperlinks: 5 verified as false positives (paths correct)
- **1.4** derivations_summary.md oversized: Already split (prior session)
- **3.4** n_c decomposition: 7 more instances standardized (completing S208 work)

Remaining from quality report (not in scope):
- 29 missing verification scripts (need creation or reference removal)
- 90 missing "Last Updated" headers (batch operation)

---

## Open Questions

1. ~~Several gauge files left ACTIVE~~ — field_content_bounds_analysis and running_couplings_crystallization now ARCHIVED (file-level pass). Only 12 legitimately ACTIVE investigations remain (all S183+).
2. The 29 missing verification scripts are the biggest remaining structural debt. Many reference archived investigations — should the references be removed rather than scripts created?
3. The 90 missing "Last Updated" headers are a pure batch operation with no physics reasoning needed.

---

## Key Context for Next Session

Structural debt is now substantially reduced. The _INDEX.md went from ~60 stale ACTIVE files to ~15-20 legitimately ACTIVE investigations plus CANONICAL/ARCHIVE. The remaining quality debt is: 29 missing scripts, 90 missing headers. These are mechanical batch operations. The highest-value next step is physics: Herm(2) spectral geometry, Om_m mechanism, Step 5 strengthening, CC sign resolution, or mass scale f derivation.
