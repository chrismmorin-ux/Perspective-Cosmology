# Session S303

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: EQ-008: Im_H normalization — why 1/(D-1) = 1/Im_H in the gauge beta function
**Topic**: Gauge (running couplings)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S296 (EQ-008: structural origin of 11/3)

## Outcome

The S296 "IRREDUCIBLE gap" — why each imaginary direction contributes exactly 1/Im_H to the gauge coefficient — is RESOLVED as [DERIVATION]. The factor 1/(D-1) in the QFT gauge beta function comes from the transverse projection operator trace. Since D = n_d = dim(H) = 4 is already assumed in the framework, D-1 = Im_H = 3 is a mathematical identity, not an independent physical assumption. The denominator of 11/3 requires ZERO new assumptions. The remaining gap is purely the numerator: identifying n_c = 11 imaginary directions with QFT gauge modes [A-PHYSICAL].

## Key Findings

1. **Denominator is [DERIVATION]** [DERIVATION]: The QFT transverse projector trace = D-1. The framework gives D = n_d = dim(H) = 4 [THEOREM via Frobenius]. Therefore D-1 = Im_H = 3 is forced. No new [A-PHYSICAL] assumption needed for the denominator. The "spatial averaging" interpretation (1/Im_H = probability per spatial direction in Im(H)) adds geometric clarity but no new content.

2. **Not a tautology** [OBSERVATION]: D-1 = Im_H has genuine content. Without the framework, D=4 is empirical. With the framework, D = dim(H) is a theorem, so D-1 = Im_H is derived. The framework explains WHY there are 3 spatial dimensions (quaternion structure), which standard physics takes as given.

3. **Numerator vs denominator asymmetry** [OBSERVATION]: The numerator (11 = n_c, QFT modes <-> imaginary directions) is [A-PHYSICAL]. The denominator (3 = Im_H = D-1) is [DERIVATION]. These are NOT parallel assumptions. The S296 "IRREDUCIBLE gap" was mislabeled as a denominator problem; the actual irreducible gap is the numerator identification only.

4. **Why D-1, not D or D-2** [OBSERVATION]: D = 4 includes temporal direction (removed by Minkowski structure). D-2 = 2 counts on-shell polarizations (but loops are off-shell). D-1 = 3 counts all transverse directions in the virtual loop. QFT selects D-1, which = Im_H.

5. **All framework quantities = 3 trace to Im_H** [OBSERVATION]: N_c, n_gen, D-1, Im_O - n_d all equal Im_H = dim(H)-1. There is essentially ONE quantity "3" in the framework appearing in different contexts. The denominator uses the "D-1" incarnation.

6. **Sigma model does NOT produce n_c/Im_H** [OBSERVATION]: Ricci/field on Gr(4,11) = (n_c-2)/4 = 9/4, not 11/3. The gauge coefficient is a gauge theory quantity, not a sigma model quantity.

7. **D-dependent formula ambiguity** [OBSERVATION]: Two candidate formulas — (D^2-D-1)/(D-1) and [D(D+1)/2+1]/(D-1) — agree at D=4 but diverge elsewhere. Only D=4 is physical. The denominator D-1 is unambiguous in all candidates.

## Open Questions

1. **Numerator identification** (EQ-008): WHY do n_c = 11 imaginary directions map to QFT gauge boson loop modes? This is the remaining [A-PHYSICAL] gap.
2. **D-dependent formula**: Which formula — (D^2-D-1)/(D-1) or [D(D+1)/2+1]/(D-1) — is the correct QFT generalization? (Untestable since only D=4 is renormalizable, but conceptually interesting.)
3. **S = S_EM = 126 coincidence** (from S296): Grassmannian scalar curvature = total EM charge index. Worth investigating or metric-normalization artifact?
4. **Numerator strengthening**: Can the paramagnetic-octonion correspondence be upgraded from [CONJECTURE] toward [DERIVATION]? Possibly via representation theory of Aut(O) = G_2 acting on loop modes.

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-008 status: denominator gap RESOLVED [DERIVATION], numerator gap = [A-PHYSICAL] (n_c <-> gauge modes). Total 114/114 PASS (6 scripts). The S296 "IRREDUCIBLE" label applied to the wrong component — the denominator was always forced by D = n_d. Future work should focus on the numerator: can the paramagnetic-octonion correspondence (non-commutative <-> anti-screening) be derived rather than postulated?
