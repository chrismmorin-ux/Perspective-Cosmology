# Session S349: Launch Phase 2 — Prediction Explorer & Publications Rendering

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: W5 (Prediction Explorer) + W8 (Publications rendering) for the website
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Outcome Summary

Built both major interactive/content deliverables for the website. The Prediction Explorer is a React island component with full filter/sort/expand functionality. The Publications page renders the 2133-line Mathematical Foundations document with KaTeX math and a TOC sidebar.

## Deliverables

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| W5: Prediction Explorer | COMPLETE | React island at /explore. 37 predictions from JSON. Filter by tier/status/domain/blind. Sort by precision/tier/name/domain. Expandable cards with framework vs measured values, caveats, script refs. |
| W8: Publications rendering | COMPLETE | Content collection pipeline. 2133-line doc with KaTeX math rendering. Sticky TOC sidebar (desktop) + collapsible TOC (mobile). Sync script for source updates. |
| Build verification | COMPLETE | 10 pages, 0 errors, 2.2s build time. 3.1MB output. |
| Visual verification | COMPLETE | Both pages verified via Playwright screenshots. |

## Files Created

- `website/src/components/PredictionExplorer.tsx` — React island (filter/sort/expand UI)
- `website/src/content/config.ts` — Astro content collection config
- `website/src/content/publications/math-foundations.md` — Math Foundations with frontmatter
- `website/scripts/sync-publications.mjs` — Source-to-content sync script

## Files Modified

- `website/src/pages/explore/index.astro` — Now uses PredictionExplorer React island
- `website/src/pages/publications/math.astro` — Full rendering with TOC sidebar
- `website/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` — Added KaTeX CSS
- `website/package.json` — Added sync-publications script
- `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` — W5+W8 status updated, session history added

## Technical Notes

- PredictionExplorer: 11KB bundle (3KB gzip). Uses React 19 with `client:load` hydration
- Publications: Astro content collection renders markdown with remark-math + rehype-katex
- TOC: Generated at build time from heading structure (h1+h2 only for manageable sidebar)
- Section 5 TOC entry shows raw LaTeX for Grassmannian — cosmetic issue, heading has `$\text{Gr}^+...$`
- KaTeX CSS loaded from CDN; could self-host later for offline/perf

## Verification Scripts

No new SymPy scripts (website session).

## Open Questions

- Section 5 TOC LaTeX rendering — minor cosmetic, could clean heading text
- Derivation chain links are stubbed (W6 not yet built)
- Sync script needs to be run manually before build when source changes

## Key Context for Next Session

Website Phase 2 is now 6/10 deliverables complete (W2-W5, W8 + landing page). The two highest-impact remaining items are W6 (Derivation chain viewer — interactive graph showing axiom-to-prediction chains) and W9 (Verification portal — curated script browser). W7 (Division algebra visualizer) and W10 (Blog) are lower priority.
