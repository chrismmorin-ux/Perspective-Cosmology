# Session 178 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Documentation audit — Phases 5-6 (CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES + core issues)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S177 (Phases 3-4: derivations_summary + divergence_registry)
**Next**: Documentation audit COMPLETE. Return to physics.

---

## Outcome

Completed the final two phases of the 6-phase documentation audit. CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md updated with all S145-S175 claims. Core theorem/axiom audit resolved one status promotion (AXM_0117) and updated the theorem registry table. All 6 audit phases now complete.

## Key Findings

1. **CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md updated** (Phase 5): Added 18 new theorems (THM_0487-04A4) with full dependency chains. Added 10 new definitions (DEF_02A3-02C4). Added 5 new S145-175 numerical predictions (sin²θ_W=28/121, R₃₁=33, HS counting metric, democratic quartic, eps* convention). Added impact matrix entries for AXM_0110, AXM_0112, AXM_0117. Expanded verification script mapping from 18 to 38 entries.

2. **Core audit** (Phase 6): Reviewed 7 critical files:
   - THM_0497 (Strong CP): SKETCH/DOWNGRADED — correct, π₃(G₂) error documented
   - THM_0486 (Mirror): SKETCH — correct, gaps acknowledged
   - THM_0491 (Hilbert space): CANONICAL — already correctly promoted
   - THM_0493 (Unitary evolution): DERIVATION — already correctly promoted
   - THM_0494 (Born rule): DERIVATION — file correct, but core/CLAUDE.md table was stale → fixed
   - AXM_0109: CANONICAL — correct
   - **AXM_0117: PROPOSED → CANONICAL** (promoted: stable 100+ sessions, used by THM_0494/0487/0498)
   - AXM_0118: Remains PROPOSED (more speculative, energy form not settled)

3. **core/CLAUDE.md updated**: Added THM_04A2 (single-photon tilt, SKETCH), THM_04A3 (beta coefficients, DERIVATION), THM_04A4 (hadronization entropy, DERIVATION). Corrected THM_0494 SKETCH→DERIVATION, THM_0497 SKETCH→SKETCH(DOWNGRADED). Updated historical notes.

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `registry/CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md` | +18 THMs, +10 DEFs, +5 predictions, +3 impact matrix, +20 scripts |
| `core/axioms/AXM_0117_crystallization_tendency.md` | PROPOSED → CANONICAL |
| `core/CLAUDE.md` | Theorem table +3 entries, corrected statuses, updated notes |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | Session registered then deregistered |
