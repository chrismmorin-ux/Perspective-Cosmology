# Session 185: Phase 3 — QM Chain Promotion

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Focus**: Phase 3 of formalization plan — promote Born rule chain to maximum rigor
**Topic**: QM chain (THM_0491, THM_0493, THM_0494, measurement, entanglement, DEF_02A1)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S182 (Phase 1 + Phase 2), S183 (speed of light), S184 (fourth-power primes, parallel)

---

## Outcome

Phase 3 of the master formalization plan is COMPLETE. All 6 items assessed. Added Session 185 assumption classifications to 4 files. Key finding: THM_0493 and THM_0494 stay at DERIVATION (at ceiling) — the irreducible gap is the continuous evolution parameter s, which is [A-STRUCTURAL] and not derivable from the discrete axioms. The measurement problem and entanglement files were already at CANONICAL, exceeding plan targets.

## Key Findings

1. **THM_0491 (Hilbert space)**: CANONICAL confirmed. All dependencies clean (AXM_0109, AXM_0110, AXM_0113, THM_0485 all CANONICAL). No action needed. [THEOREM]

2. **THM_0493 (unitary evolution)**: Stays at DERIVATION — at ceiling. The continuous parameter s is the single irreducible [A-STRUCTURAL] gap: axioms define discrete transitions, continuous s is needed for Stone's theorem, and no derivation path exists. Also: norm=content identification is [A-PHYSICAL]. 11-component assumption classification added. [DERIVATION]

3. **THM_0494 (Born rule)**: Stays at DERIVATION — depends on THM_0493 so inherits its ceiling. The mathematical content is complete: existence (S169, 11/11 PASS), uniqueness (S173, 37/37 PASS), robustness (S173, 37/37 PASS). 11-component assumption classification added. This is the framework's strongest QM result. [DERIVATION]

4. **Measurement problem**: Already at CANONICAL with 91/91 PASS across 6 scripts. 18-row QM feature classification + 5-row irreducible assumptions table added. Math part is THEOREM level; physical interpretation is DERIVATION level. [CANONICAL]

5. **Entanglement**: Already at CANONICAL with 113/113 PASS across 9 scripts. Stale status references fixed (THM_0491 SKETCH→CANONICAL, THM_0493/0494 SKETCH→DERIVATION). 14-row finding classification + 7-row dependency chain assessment added. [CANONICAL]

6. **DEF_02A1 (decoherence rate)**: RED-FLAG already resolved by S181 assumption classification — τ₀ tagged [A-IMPORT: Planck time]. No further action needed. [DERIVATION]

## Open Questions

1. **Can continuous parameter s be derived from axioms?** This is the single bottleneck preventing THM_0493 → CANONICAL. Possible approach: show discrete transition group embeds into continuous one-parameter group by density argument. No concrete path identified.

2. **Should [A-PHYSICAL] identifications (norm=probability, measurement=crystallization) be promoted to correspondence axioms?** Currently these are informal Layer 2 rules. Making them explicit axioms would clarify the framework's assumptions.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 3 is complete. The QM chain is the framework's strongest area: THM_0491 CANONICAL, THM_0493/0494 DERIVATION (at ceiling, math proofs complete), measurement CANONICAL, entanglement CANONICAL. The irreducible gap is the continuous parameter s in THM_0493.

The master plan (mossy-snuggling-puffin.md) next calls for:
- **Phase 4**: Particle Physics Audit (alpha chain, mass formulas, mixing angles, collider) — 10-14 sessions
- **Phase 5**: Cosmology Cleanup — 6-9 sessions (can parallel with Phase 4)
- **Phase 6**: Gravity Assessment — 4-5 sessions (can parallel with Phase 4)

Phases 4/5/6 can run in parallel after the QM foundation is solid (which it now is).
