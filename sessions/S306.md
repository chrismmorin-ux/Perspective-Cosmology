# Session S306: IRA-04 rho Derivation Attempt

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Can the quartic ratio rho = c_4/b_4 be derived from CW dynamics or other principles?
**Topic**: `framework/IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S298 (IRA-04 partially resolved), S304 (IRA-01 resolved)
**Next**: New physics topic; rho = 11/3 [CONJECTURE] could be tested if shape mode masses become observable

---

## Outcome

**IRA-04 irreducibility CONFIRMED**. The ratio rho = c_4/b_4 cannot be derived from perturbative CW analysis. It requires non-perturbative strong sector dynamics beyond the axioms. IRA count unchanged at 4. One structural candidate identified: rho = 11/3 = n_c/Im_H [CONJECTURE] from gauge loops with equal log factors.

## Key Findings

1. **Gauge loop structure** [DERIVATION]: Broken gauge bosons (28) contribute only Tr(G^2) to the quartic CW potential. SO(4) gauge bosons (6) contribute both 3*(Tr G)^2 + 4*Tr(G^2) at quartic order. Identity verified: sum_{i<j} (x_i-x_j)^4 = 4*S_4 + 3*S_2^2 when sum x_i = 0.

2. **rho = 11/3 candidate** [CONJECTURE]: If SO(4) and broken gauge boson log factors are equal, rho = (4+7)/3 = 11/3 = n_c/Im_H. This gives m_S^2/m_R^2 = 11/23 = n_c/(n_c + 4*Im_H). Same 11/3 ratio as EQ-008 beta coefficients and glueball intercept 10/3 = 11/3 - 1/3. Would unify three disparate results through n_c/Im_H.

3. **Fermion dominance** [DERIVATION]: Fermion loops dominate gauge loops for the (Tr G)^2 coefficient by a factor ~4700 (because y_t^4/g^4 ~ 137^2 ~ 18800). Perturbative rho ~ 5×10^{-4}, making shape modes quasi-massless.

4. **Irreducibility confirmed** [THEOREM-level]: The perturbative CW analysis cannot fix rho — it depends on the non-perturbative dynamics of the crystallization. Neither the RG fixed point approach nor the self-consistency bootstrap is tractable with current tools.

5. **No impact on predictions**: rho does not affect alpha, sin^2(theta_W), Omega_m, gauge groups, generations, or any currently derived prediction. Affects only shape mode mass spectrum (unobserved).

## Open Questions

1. **rho = 11/3 testability**: If shape mode masses become observable (composite Higgs searches at future colliders), can rho be measured? m_S/m_R ~ 0.69 if rho = 11/3.
2. **Non-perturbative gap equation**: Can lattice methods or holographic duality fix rho for SO(11) strong dynamics?
3. **11/3 unification**: The connection rho = 11/3 = beta coefficient ratio = glueball intercept - 1/3 would be significant if confirmed. All trace to n_c/Im_H.

## Key Context for Next Session

IRA-04's irreducibility is now CONFIRMED by explicit CW analysis. The perturbative potential cannot fix rho: gauge loops give Tr(G^2) only, fermion loops give (Tr G)^2 only, and the ratio depends on non-perturbative dynamics. One structural candidate rho = 11/3 = n_c/Im_H emerges from equal-log-factor assumption [CONJECTURE]. IRA count remains 4 (IRA-04 [A-STRUCTURAL LOW], IRA-06/07 [A-PHYSICAL Weinberg-forced], IRA-11 [A-IMPORT]). No current prediction is affected by rho. The framework's assumption inventory is essentially complete.
