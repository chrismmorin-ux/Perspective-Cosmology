# Session 226: Cyclotomic 43 — Numerator Mechanism and Structural Stress Test (EQ-012)

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Numerator derivation attempt, denominator uniqueness stress test, sum rules
**Topic**: Cyclotomic pattern (EQ-012)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S216 (three-sector decomposition), S211 (uniqueness test)

---

## Outcome

Comprehensive stress test of the Phi_6 cyclotomic pattern. Two major findings:

1. **Denominator uniqueness ESTABLISHED**: D=43 is the ONLY denominator in [2,200] that simultaneously fits both v/m_p and m_mu/m_e with small integer numerators (1/199). Phi_6 is the ONLY cyclotomic polynomial (n=1..30) and the ONLY monic quadratic (b,c in [-5,5]) that achieves the triple fit (alpha + both mass ratios). This CORRECTS S211's "uniqueness FAILS" conclusion — that earlier test used a weaker single-point criterion.

2. **Numerator sum rules discovered**: Sector sums B_spacetime = 1 = R^2, B_crystal = 4 = C^2, B_hidden = 18+(-10)+1 = 9 = Im_H^2, total = 14 = dim(G_2). The {1^2, 2^2, 3^2} pattern is real and mildly significant (p ~ 0.5% adjusted). However, the hidden-sector sum is tautological (follows from O+1 = Im_H^2), and individual numerators remain [CONJECTURE] with 1252 alternative partitions.

**No numerator derivation mechanism found.** Session meets pass/fail via the "OR" path: documenting the post-hoc nature of numerators with explicit caveats.

## Key Findings

### 1. D=43 Uniqueness [EMPIRICAL + DERIVATION]

**Denominator scan** (D in [2, 200], tolerance 0.05, |B| <= 20):
- Good for v/m_p alone: 4 out of 199 (2.0%)
- Good for m_mu/m_e alone: 9 out of 199 (4.5%)
- Good for BOTH simultaneously: **1 out of 199 (0.5%) — D=43 only**

**Polynomial triple fit** (x^2+bx+c, b,c in [-5,5]):
- Must fit alpha at p(11) AND both mass ratios at p(7): **1/121 — Phi_6 only**

**Cyclotomic comparison** (Phi_n, n=1..30):
- Good dual fits at k=7: **1 — Phi_6 only**

**Quadratic uniqueness theorem** [THEOREM]:
- The unique monic quadratic with p(7)=43 AND p(4)=13 is p(x)=x^2-x+1=Phi_6
- Proof: linear system 7b+c=-6, 4b+c=-3 gives b=-1, c=1 uniquely
- Bonus: p(11)=111 (alpha denominator) follows automatically

**S211 correction**: S211 concluded "uniqueness FAILS" based on testing polynomials at k=7 ALONE and finding a few alternatives. The stronger two-point test (k=7 AND k=11) and the direct denominator scan both show D=43 IS unique. S211's single-point criterion was too weak.

### 2. Numerator Sum Rules [CONJECTURE]

| Sector | Formulas | B values | Sum | = |
|--------|----------|----------|-----|---|
| Spacetime u(4) | m_s/m_c | 1 | 1 | R^2 = 1^2 |
| Crystal u(11) | alpha | 4 | 4 | C^2 = 2^2 |
| Hidden u(7) | v/m_p, m_mu/m_e, m_u/m_s | 18, -10, 1 | 9 | Im_H^2 = 3^2 |
| **Total** | all 5 | — | **14** | **C*Im_O = dim(G_2)** |

Sector sums are **{1^2, 2^2, 3^2} = {R^2, C^2, Im_H^2}** — consecutive perfect squares indexed by division algebra dimensions.

### 3. Tautology Assessment [MATHEMATICAL FACT]

The hidden-sector sum rule B_hidden = Im_H^2 = 9 reduces algebraically:

C*Im_H^2 - (C+O) + R = O*(C-1) + R = O*Im_C + R = O + 1 = Im_H^2

This is a TAUTOLOGY given the individual decompositions, following from the identity O + 1 = Im_H^2 (i.e., 8 + 1 = 9, a consequence of Cayley-Dickson structure).

**What IS NOT tautological**:
- The {1^2, 2^2, 3^2} pattern across all three sectors (cross-sector correlation)
- The total B = 14 = dim(G_2) = dim(Aut(O))
- The specific sector assignment (which B values go to which sector)

### 4. Numerator Derivation: FAILED [CONJECTURE]

Tested approaches:
- **Born rule analogy**: No mechanism derived for WHY B=18 or B=-10 in u(7) sector
- **u(7) representations**: B values {18, -10, 1} are NOT standard u(7) rep dimensions (those are 1, 7, 21, 28, 35, 49)
- **Division algebra decomposition**: All B values decompose (18=C*Im_H^2, -10=-(C+O), 1=R, 4=n_d) but decompositions are NOT unique (14-50 alternatives each)
- **Partition**: 1252 ways to split 9 into framework-expressible ordered triples
- **Assessment**: POST-HOC pattern matching, not derivation

### 5. Falsifiable Predictions [CONJECTURE]

**P1**: No additional D=43 formulas with B != 0 exist (hidden-sector budget exhausted at Im_H^2 = 9)

**P2**: No additional D=13 formulas with B != 0 exist (spacetime budget exhausted at R^2 = 1)

**P3**: Cross-sector channels (55 = 2*n_d*Im_O - 1 = C(11,2)) do NOT appear in any known formula. If they appear in a future formula, the three-sector model gains predictive power.

### 6. Cross-Sector Channels [OBSERVATION]

55 = 2*n_d*Im_O - 1 (inter-sector EM channels) does not appear in any known formula number. 56 = 2*n_d*Im_O (cross-sector generators) appears as a factor in 784 = 56*14 (Koide M denominator), where 784 = 4*n_d*Im_O^2 = n_d*(C*Im_O)^2.

## Confidence Assessment

| Sub-claim | Old | New | Justification |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------------|
| D=43 uniqueness among [2,200] | — | [EMPIRICAL] | 1/199 in dual-fit scan |
| Phi_6 uniqueness among cyclotomics | — | [EMPIRICAL] | 1/30 at k=7 |
| Phi_6 uniqueness among monic quadratics | — | [THEOREM] | Two-point constraint determines p(x) |
| Sector sums = {1^2, 2^2, 3^2} | — | [CONJECTURE] | Verified fact, no derivation, p~0.5% |
| B_total = 14 = dim(G_2) | — | [SPECULATION] | 14 has many decompositions |
| Hidden sum rule tautological | — | [MATHEMATICAL FACT] | Follows from O+1=Im_H^2 |
| Numerator mechanism | [CONJECTURE] | [CONJECTURE] | No progress, confirmed post-hoc |
| S211 uniqueness failure | [OBSERVATION] | **CORRECTED** | Two-point test restores uniqueness |

**EQ-012 update**: Denominator selection now both structurally derived AND empirically unique. Numerator selection confirmed [CONJECTURE] with sum rule structure. Full formulas remain [CONJECTURE].

## Open Questions (EQ references)

1. **Numerator mechanism** (EQ-012 remaining gap): WHY are numerators {4, 18, -10, 1} and not something else? Need: Born-rule-like mechanism in hidden sector, or proof that sector budgets = {R^2, C^2, Im_H^2}.
2. **Sector budget derivation**: Can {1^2, 2^2, 3^2} be derived from the Born rule on u(k) sectors? The alpha formula's B=n_d was derived this way (S89). Extension to hidden sector unproven.
3. **G_2 total**: Is B_total = 14 = dim(G_2) a coincidence or structural? 14 = C*Im_O = O + Im_O - 1. Needs investigation of G_2 role in framework.
4. **Cross-sector channels**: The 55 inter-sector channels remain an untested structural prediction.

## Key Context for Next Session

The cyclotomic 43 pattern is now well-characterized with TWO layers of structure:
- **Denominator layer** [DERIVATION + EMPIRICAL]: Phi_6(k) = EM channels in u(k), with D=43 uniquely selected. Corrects S211 uniqueness failure.
- **Numerator layer** [CONJECTURE]: B values have division algebra decompositions and satisfy {1^2, 2^2, 3^2} sector sum rules, but no derivation mechanism exists. The hidden sum is tautological (O+1=9); the cross-sector pattern is not.

The numerator gap is the main open issue for EQ-012. Next productive step: attempt Born-rule derivation of sector budgets (extending the alpha mechanism to u(7) and u(4) sectors), or accept numerators as unexplained and focus elsewhere.
