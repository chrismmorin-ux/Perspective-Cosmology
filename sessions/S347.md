# Session S347: Alpha D_3 Derivation Attempt + Phase 3 Propagation

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Investigate three routes to derive D_3=1; propagate Phase 3 results across repository
**Continues**: S344 (CCWZ Phase 3 COMPLETE)

## Key Findings

### 1. D_3 Derivation Attempt: Three Routes [CONJECTURE, strengthened]

Investigated whether D_3 = 1 can be DERIVED from coset structure:

**Route 1 (VEV mode counting) [PLAUSIBLE]**:
- D_3 = N_VEV = N_physical_Higgs = k - (k-1) = 4 - 3 = 1
- Three independent countings converge: VEV directions, physical Higgs (4 total - 3 eaten), neutral VEV modes
- Sign is correct: tree overshoots, two-loop undershoots, three-loop corrects
- MISSING: explicit CW potential calculation at two-loop in composite sector

**Route 2 (alternating signs) [CONSISTENT]**:
- Sign pattern (+, -, +) is standard perturbation theory
- c_1 = 0 is STRUCTURALLY NECESSARY (no EM charge weighting at O(alpha)) [DERIVATION]
- NOT a geometric series (epsilon^2/d3_term ~ 8e-5)
- Signs alone don't determine D_3 uniquely

**Route 3 (2D sigma model) [CONTEXTUAL]**:
- C_2 = k*(n-k-1)/n in Grassmannian notation (k=4, n=11) -- verified
- sum(Q^2)_colored = k*(n-k-1)/2 = 12 -- explained structurally (6 copies of defect quartet with sum Q^2 = 2)
- D_3 = k-(k-1) = 1 in EWSB counting
- 2D sigma model beta function coefficients do NOT directly match 4D (different expansion structures)
- Grassmannian-specific 3-loop data (Wegner) not computable without Casimir computation

**Overall**: Multi-route convergence STRENGTHENS D_3=1 conjecture but does NOT upgrade to [DERIVATION]. D_3 = 1 remains [CONJECTURE, HRS 5].

### 2. Grassmannian Formula for C_2 [DERIVATION]

C_2 = k*(n-k-1)/n = 4*6/11 = 24/11 where:
- k = n_d = 4 (defect dimension)
- n = n_c = 11 (total crystal dimension)
- n-k-1 = 6 (colored crystal indices)

This is a clean Grassmannian expression, not just numerology. The full alpha formula in Grassmannian notation:
1/alpha = N_I/111 - k*(n-k-1)/n * alpha^2/pi + [k-(k-1)] * alpha^3/pi

### 3. Phase 3 Propagation Complete (Comprehensive Audit)

Updated ~35 files across the repository. Comprehensive grep audit for "5.9 sigma", "0.0009 ppm", "C_2.*CONJECTURE":

**Source files** (18): claims/TIER_1_SIGNIFICANT.md, claims/UNDENIABLE_CORE.md, publications/TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md, HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md, THESIS.md, PC_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md, PLAIN_LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION.md, launch/content/FOR_SKEPTICS.md, THEORY_STRUCTURE.md, framework/STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS_HONEST.md (2 locations), alpha_accuracy_plan.md, alpha_radiative_gap.md (~12 locations), registry/derivations/INDEX.md, alpha_derivations.md, CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md, RED_TEAM_SUMMARY_V3.md, PROPAGATION_MANIFEST.md (PROP-027)

**Website** (4): math-foundations.md (3 locations), predictions.json, derivation-graph.json, extract-predictions.mjs

**Verification scripts** (13+): All scripts referencing C_2 or 5.9 sigma updated (docstrings only, no code changes)

Key changes: C_2 upgraded to [DERIVATION], "5.9 sigma" qualified as "(2-loop)", three-loop 0.0006 sigma added with [CONJECTURE, HRS 5], Avenue 9 status updated to PARTIALLY RESOLVED.

## Honest Assessment

**What's strong**:
- Three independent routes all give D_3 = 1
- C_2 has a clean Grassmannian interpretation
- c_1 = 0 is structurally derived (not assumed)
- Propagation is clean and consistent

**What's weak**:
- D_3 = 1 is still post-hoc (1 parameter to 1 number)
- No route achieves a genuine derivation
- The "three routes converge" argument is plausibility, not proof
- Multi-route convergence could be confirmation bias on an integer

## Scripts

| Script | Tests | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `alpha_d3_derivation_attempt.py` | 23/23 PASS | NEW (S347) |

## Open Questions

1. **CW potential at two-loop on the coset**: Would give genuine derivation of D_3
2. **Grassmannian Casimir at fourth order**: Needed for Wegner's 3-loop formula on Gr(4,11)
3. **Four-loop prediction**: C_4 ~ -0.04 in alpha^4/pi^2 basis, but 1600x below CODATA uncertainty

## Key Context for Next Session

D_3 derivation attempt is complete (inconclusive). The alpha prediction chain is mature:
- Tree: 15211/111 [DERIVATION, 0 params]
- C_2 = 24/11 = k*(n-k-1)/n [DERIVATION, from defect charges, Grassmannian formula]
- D_3 = 1 = k-(k-1) [CONJECTURE, HRS 5, multi-route plausibility]

Next alpha work requires either: (a) genuine two-loop CW calculation on the coset, or (b) move to other topics. The D_3 question is well-characterized and documented.
