# Session 241: Crystallization Catalog Phase 8 — Meta-Analysis & Refactoring

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Meta-analysis of all 99 catalog entries across 25 sub-catalog files; create SUMMARY.md, TAG_INDEX.md; identify investigation priorities
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S239 (Phase 7 COMPLETE)

---

## Outcome

Phase 8 meta-analysis of the entire crystallization catalog is complete. Six parallel agents extracted structured data from all 25 sub-catalog files across 6 subdirectories, compiled into two new index files (SUMMARY.md, TAG_INDEX.md) and a comprehensive investigation priority list. No original files were re-read by the main session — all analysis derived from agent outputs.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Tag distribution** [VERIFIED by 6-agent parallel extraction]: 3 FRAMEWORK-DERIVED (3.0%), 34 FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED (34.3%), 62 STANDARD-RELABELED (62.6%). The framework adds genuine predictive content to ~37% of cataloged processes.

2. **Most-used framework quantities**: N_c = Im_H = 3 dominates (~25 entries), followed by sin^2 theta_W = 28/121 (~12), alpha = 1/137 (~10), N_nu = Im_H = 3 (~6). These four quantities account for the vast majority of framework content.

3. **Highest-density sub-catalogs**: ewsb_detailed.md and strong_scattering.md are 100% framework-content (all entries D or C). Lowest: 7 files at 0% (nuclear_decays, nuclear_binding, qcd_phase, grav_scattering, grav_waves, high_energy_astro, baryogenesis).

4. **Verification gaps**: Only 2 CONSTRAINED entries lack scripts (Bhabha #17, Moller #18 scattering). 25 RELABELED entries lack scripts (appropriate — no framework predictions to verify).

5. **Inconsistencies found** (12 total across all subdirs):
   - 6 dual-tagged/ambiguous entries needing primary tag clarification
   - 1 mistagging: stochastic GW background (#82) has r=7/128 prediction but tagged RELABELED
   - 1 critical discrepancy: DM mass formula gives 15.5 MeV not 5.11 GeV (EQ-013)
   - 1 red flag: Omega_Lambda = 137/200 numerology concern
   - 1 active tension: r = 7/128 vs BICEP/Keck r < 0.036
   - 2 minor: nuclear magic number [SPECULATION] vs summary tagging; EW baryogenesis has xi but tagged R

6. **Cross-reference audit**: J/psi and Upsilon appear in both hadron_formation.md and quarkonia_and_glueballs.md — intentional and properly cross-referenced (formation vs spectral focus).

## Investigation Priorities (from compiled data)

### Top 10 Highest-Impact Investigations

| Rank | Investigation | Impact | EQ | Rationale |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | **Resolve DM mass discrepancy** | CRITICAL | EQ-013 | Formula gives 15.5 MeV, not 5.11 GeV. 2 catalog entries affected. Credibility issue. |
| 2 | **Resolve r formula ambiguity** | HIGH | EQ-032 | 7/200 vs 7/128. Latter violates BICEP/Keck. Active falsification pressure. 2 entries affected. |
| 3 | **Derive Omega_m = 63/200 mechanism** | HIGH | EQ-002 | Would upgrade 3+ entries (BAO, CMB, dark energy). Triple-formula red flag. |
| 4 | **CKM matrix derivation** | HIGH | — | Would upgrade 5+ decay entries. Biggest gap in particle physics catalog. |
| 5 | **EW baryogenesis PT strength from xi=4/121** | MEDIUM | — | New physics: does composite Higgs produce first-order transition? Could upgrade baryogenesis from 0/4 C. |
| 6 | **V_0 inflationary amplitude** | MEDIUM | EQ-011 | Would complete inflation DERIVED chain. Currently blocked on EQ-020 (resolved). |
| 7 | **Top Yukawa from SO(11)** | MEDIUM | EQ-006 | Would upgrade top decay + fermion mass entries. Lambda_H = 125/968 chain depends on it. |
| 8 | **Bhabha/Moller verification scripts** | LOW | EQ-030 | Only 2 CONSTRAINED entries without scripts. Quick fix. |
| 9 | **Stochastic GW re-tagging** | LOW | — | Contains r=7/128 blind prediction. Should be CONSTRAINED not RELABELED. |
| 10 | **QCD confinement from N_c=3** | LONG-TERM | — | Would upgrade 4+ QCD entries from RELABELED. Requires non-perturbative dynamics. |

### Upgrade Candidates (RELABELED -> CONSTRAINED)

| # | Process | Current | Path to Upgrade |
|---|---------|---------|-----------------|
| 82 | Stochastic GW background | R | Re-tag to C (r=7/128 is a real blind prediction) |
| 67 | EW baryogenesis | R | Calculate finite-T potential with xi=4/121 |
| 2 | Muon decay | R | If m_mu/m_e = Phi_6(43) confirmed, becomes C |
| 3 | Charged pion decay | R | Via muon mass helicity suppression |
| 73 | Type Ia SN | R | m_p/m_e enters M_Chandrasekhar (already framework-derived) |
| 8 | Higgs decay | R | kappa_V = sqrt(117/121) is genuinely CONSTRAINED |

### Downgrade / Correction Candidates

| # | Process | Current | Issue |
|---|---------|---------|-------|
| 92,94 | DM halo/interactions | C | Formula gives wrong mass — downgrade to R or fix formula |
| 95 | Dark energy / CC | C | Omega_Lambda=137/200 has triple-formula red flag |
| 42 | Magic numbers | R | Text says [SPECULATION] — add explicit disclaimer |

### Scripts Needed

| Script | For Entries | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| bhabha_z_pole_crystallization.py | #17 Bhabha at Z-pole | MEDIUM |
| moller_parity_violation.py | #18 Moller PV sin^2 test | MEDIUM |

|------|---------|
| `framework/crystallization_processes/README.md` | Added SUMMARY.md, TAG_INDEX.md to structure |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | S241 deregistered |

## Open Questions

1. **DM mass discrepancy** (EQ-013): m_e * n_c^2/n_d = 15.5 MeV, not 5.11 GeV. Is the formula wrong, or the interpretation?
2. **r formula ambiguity** (EQ-032): 7/200 or 7/128? CMB-S4 (~2028) will resolve.
3. **CKM derivation gap**: Blocks upgrading ~5 weak decay entries. No mechanism exists.
4. **Baryogenesis gap**: 0/4 entries constrained. Weakest sub-catalog. Finite-T potential with xi=4/121 is the one calculable path.
5. **Stochastic GW re-tagging**: Should #82 be upgraded from R to C given r=7/128 blind prediction?

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 8 meta-analysis is COMPLETE. Two new index files (SUMMARY.md, TAG_INDEX.md) provide one-stop access to all 99 entries with tag distributions, framework quantity usage, and verification coverage. The catalog's honest structure is: 3% genuinely derived, 34% constrained by derived quantities, 63% organizational relabeling. The framework's strength is concentrated in EWSB (Gr(4,11) coset), strong interactions (N_c=3), and inflation (hilltop potential). Its weakness is in baryogenesis, nuclear physics, and complex astrophysics.

**Priority investigations**: DM mass discrepancy (EQ-013, credibility), r ambiguity (EQ-032, falsification), Omega_m mechanism (EQ-002, upgrade potential).
