# Session S313

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: Wolf space fork structure: F_4 role, chain sums, chi sequence, fork gap theorem
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S312 (G_2/SO(4) Wolf space + structural identities)
**Next**: New topic (wolf space chain essentially complete)

---

## Outcome

Three questions from S312 resolved. F_4 does NOT extend the framework's Lie algebra chain -- it and SO(11) are incompatible extensions of SO(7), forking at the hidden intermediate so(9). The generator gap dim(so(11)) - dim(F_4) = 3 = Im_H is derived from the triple identity n_d^2 = 2^n_d [DERIVATION]. The gap decomposes as Im_C + dim_C = 1 + 2 = Im_H, matching the Cayley-Dickson doubling C -> H. The chi sequence {3, 7} terminates because Hurwitz forbids post-octonionic division algebras.

## Key Findings

1. **F_4 and SO(11) are incompatible extensions of SO(7)** [DERIVATION]: F_4 has rank 4 (= n_d), SO(11) has rank 5. dim(F_4) = 52 < dim(so(11)) = 55. F_4 = Aut(J_3(O)) lives in octonionic world; SO(11) is the crystal symmetry. The chain so(4) subset G_2 subset SO(7) is the shared octonionic core; SO(7) -> SO(11) exits the octonionic hierarchy.

2. **The fork is at so(9), not so(7)** [DERIVATION]: Both SO(11) and F_4 contain so(9) = so(dim_O+1) = so(Im_H^2). R^{n_c} = R^9 + R^2 = (octonionic core) + (complex extension). SO(11) extends so(9) classically (adds so(2) + R^9 x R^2 = 19 generators); F_4 extends spinorially (adds Delta_9 = 2^{n_d} = 16 generators).

3. **Fork Gap Theorem: dim(so(n_c)) - dim(F_4) = Im_H** [DERIVATION]: Gap = 19 - 16 = 3. The gap equals Im_H because n_d^2 = 2^{n_d} (triple identity, unique at n_d = 4). Classical extension costs n_d^2 + Im_H generators; spinorial costs n_d^2. Surplus = Im_H.

4. **Gap = Im_C + dim_C = 1 + 2 (Cayley-Dickson C -> H)** [DERIVATION]: The Im_C = 1 comes from so(2) (complex phase rotation). The dim_C = 2 comes from cross-term excess (18 classical - 16 spinorial). This matches the Cayley-Dickson doubling from C to H exactly. The three extra generators in SO(11) vs F_4 correspond to the three imaginary quaternion units.

5. **9 = Im_H^2 = dim_O+1 = 2n_d+1 = n_c-dim_C** [THEOREM]: All four expressions for the fork-point dimension coincide only at n_d=4, Im_H=3. The identity Im_H^2 = 2*Im_H + 3 has unique positive solution Im_H = 3.

6. **dim(F_4) = n_d * Phi_6(n_d) = 4 * 13 = 52** [DERIVATION]: Also 52 = C(n_c,2) - Im_H = so(11) - Im_H. And 52 = C(9,2) + 2^{n_d} = so(9) + spinor.

7. **Chi sequence {3, 7} terminates by Hurwitz** [DERIVATION]: G_2 Wolf chi = Im_H, F_4 Wolf chi = Im_O. No Wolf space has chi = n_c = 11 (not exceptional, not Gr_4^+; HP^10 has chi=11 but dim=40 = not framework). Termination forced because no division algebra exists after O.

8. **n^2 = 2^n has solutions {2, 4} = {dim_C, n_d}** [THEOREM]: Both framework dimensions satisfy the triple identity. This connects to the fork: the R^2 extension (dim_C) and the full spacetime R^4 (n_d) are the two solutions.

9. **Chi product = dim(so(7)), chi sum = n_c - 1** [DERIVATION]: Im_H * Im_O = 21 = dim(so(7)) (the shared algebra). Im_H + Im_O = 10 = n_c - 1.

10. **Wolf space dim sum = C(9,2)** [DERIVATION]: 8 + 28 = 36 = dim(so(9)), the fork-point algebra.

## Open Questions

None from this session. The wolf space chain investigation is essentially complete:
- Q1 RESOLVED: F_4 is incompatible with SO(11), not an extension
- Q2 RESOLVED: Chain sums partially structural (36=C(9,2)), no clean 28 decomposition
- Q3 RESOLVED: Chi terminates by Hurwitz, no chi=11 Wolf space exists

---

## Key Context for Next Session

The fork gap theorem connects the triple identity n_d^2 = 2^n_d to the Lie algebra dimension gap between SO(11) and F_4. The fork at so(9) reveals R^11 = R^9 + R^2 = (octonionic core) + (complex extension), with the gap Im_H = 3 encoding the Cayley-Dickson step C -> H. The wolf space chain {G_2/SO(4), F_4/(Sp(3)*Sp(1))} is a complete division-algebra-indexed pair that terminates at octonions. 53/53 PASS (2 scripts).
