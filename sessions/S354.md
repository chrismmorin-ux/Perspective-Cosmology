# Session S354: Launch C1b Chunk 5 + W9 Verification Portal

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: (A) Interpretive Companion v1.0 Chunk 5; (B) W9 Verification Portal
**Parallel tracks**: C1b and website ran concurrently

---

## Outcome

**C1b Chunk 5 COMPLETE.** Part V: Extended Results (Sections 17-20) written into `PC_INTERPRETIVE_COMPANION.md`. Document now at 1989 lines (up from 1614). ~375 new lines.

## Key Findings

### What Was Written

| Component | Lines | Content |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Part V header | ~8 | Introduction: extending to mass spectra, cosmology, honest accounting |
| Section 17 | ~95 | Yang-Mills Mass Gap: n_d=4 uniqueness, Casimir spectroscopy, additive formula (5 states, 1-5%), large-N prediction 10/3+2/N^2. Honest: NOT a mass gap proof |
| Section 18 | ~85 | Matter Density: structure algebra su(4)+su(7), dual-role generators, 137+63=200 equipartition, F=63/200 (0.04 sigma). Killing excluded at 14 sigma |
| Section 19 | ~85 | What the Framework Predicts: Tier 1 table (12 sub-10 ppm), blind predictions (P~10^-8), tree-to-dressed bands, 14 falsifications, 25-40% probability |
| Section 20 | ~90 | Open Problems: 4 IRAs, derivation-vs-discovery, testable predictions (CMB-S4, SuperCDMS, HL-LHC), expert review checklist, honest bottom line |
| Derivation chain | ~12 | Part V summary table |

### Design Decisions

1. **Section 17 mirrors math Sec 17 directly**: glueball mass formula with full lattice comparison table. Honest caveat that this is NOT a mass gap proof
2. **Section 18 mirrors math Sec 16**: Omega_m = 63/200 derivation moved from companion Part IV to Part V (per S353 design decision)
3. **Sections 19-20 are companion-only**: no direct math paper mirror. Draw from HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md, TIER_1_SIGNIFICANT.md, BLIND_PREDICTIONS.md, IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md
4. **Section 19 includes all 14 falsifications**: honest accounting is central to credibility
5. **Section 20 ends with "The honest bottom line"**: echoes HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md tone
6. **No new [A-PHYSICAL] IRAs in Part V**: only reuses IRA-06 (established Part II) and adds one physical identification (structure channel = matter density)
7. **Adapted format for Sections 19-20**: summative sections use tables and lists rather than theorem-by-theorem structure. "What Would Falsify" adapted to "What the 25-40% Means" and "Expert Review Checklist"

### Chunk Plan Progress

| Chunk | Sections | Status | Lines |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| **1** | Frontmatter + 1-4 | **COMPLETE (S345)** | 456 |
| **2** | 5-8 | **COMPLETE (S348)** | ~395 |
| **3** | 9-12 | **COMPLETE (S350)** | ~367 |
| **4** | 13-16 | **COMPLETE (S353)** | ~395 |
| **5** | 17-20 | **COMPLETE (S354)** | ~375 |
| 6 | Appendices + review | NOT STARTED | ~350 est |

## Scripts

No new verification scripts (companion is interpretive, not computational). All referenced scripts already exist.

## Open Questions

- Chunk 6 (Appendices + full-document review) covers: Appendix A (Radon-Hurwitz), Appendix B (verification script index), cross-chunk consistency review, final status update to "1.0 COMPLETE"
- Total document now at 1989 lines across 5 chunks

## Track B: W9 Verification Portal

### Outcome

Built the Verification Portal at `/verify` — a React island showcasing the framework's 735+ SymPy verification scripts as a curated, browsable collection.

### Deliverables

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| W9: Verification Portal | COMPLETE | React island. 8 featured + 19 curated = 27 scripts. Domain filtering, card expand/collapse. |
| verification-scripts.json | COMPLETE | Stats, 8 domains, 27 scripts with descriptions, formulas, precision, test counts. |
| Static sections | COMPLETE | "Run them yourself" (3-step), "Verification methodology" (proves/doesn't), GitHub placeholder. |
| Build | COMPLETE | 10 pages, 0 errors, 2.18s. Component: 5.98 KB (1.91 KB gzip). |

### Files Created (W9)

- `website/data/verification-scripts.json`
- `website/src/components/VerificationPortal.tsx`

### Files Modified (W9)

- `website/src/pages/verify/index.astro` — Stub replaced with live component
- `website/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` — Footer count 713+ -> 735+
- `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` — W9 status, session history

### Technical Notes (W9)

- **8 featured scripts**: alpha, Weinberg, H_0, Omega_Lambda, Omega_m, CONJ-A3, 3 generations, Schrodinger
- **Domain filtering**: 8 colored domain pills with counts
- **Card expansion**: Formula, measured value, test count, filename, run command
- **Honesty**: "What this proves (and doesn't)" flags numerology risk explicitly

## Key Context for Next Session

- **C1b**: Chunk 6 (final) — Appendices + full-document review. Sources: math paper Appendix A, full companion doc, verification/sympy/ directory
- **Website**: Phase 2 at **8/10 deliverables** (W2-W6, W8-W9 + landing). Remaining: W7 (division algebra visualizer), W10 (blog). Essentially launch-ready.
