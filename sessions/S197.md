# Session 197 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: Evaluation Map Foundations — Lorentz signature, spectral metric, C*-algebra QM route
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/meta/evaluation_map_foundations.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S196 (recursive gap tower) — note: this work continues a plan originally started in a continuation session that referenced "S188" for the evaluation map theorems
**Next**: Gauge structure from hidden space, or session bookkeeping catch-up

## Outcome

Extended the evaluation map chain with three major results: (1) spectral metric selection argument upgrading det-vs-Tr from [CONJECTURE] to [DERIVATION], (2) Lorentz signature fully derived from observable algebra with 1+3 split, (3) C*-algebra route providing third independent path to quantum mechanics.

The evaluation map chain now derives: perspectives exist (THM_04AC) -> k=4 (THM_04AD) -> Lorentz signature (1,3) with 1+3 split (THM_04AE a-f) -> spectral metric from crystallization dynamics (THM_04AE g) -> C*-algebra observable structure -> QM (density matrices, Born rule, superposition).

## Key Findings

### 1. Spectral Metric Selection [DERIVATION]

THM_04AE Part (g): The determinant form det(X) is the physically relevant metric (not Tr(X^2)) because:
- Cayley-Hamilton: det and Tr are the ONLY polynomial invariants of M_2(C) [I-MATH]
- Eigenvalue gap = sqrt(Tr^2 - 4*det) is purely spatial, depends on det [I-MATH]
- Transition probability (Rabi) is independent of E = Tr/2 [I-MATH]
- Light cone det(DX)=0 means shared eigenvector (spectral information preservation) [I-MATH]
- det distinguishes timelike from spacelike; Tr and Tr(X^2) cannot [I-MATH]
- Two observables can have identical Tr(X^2) but opposite det — Euclidean is blind to causal structure

Remaining gap: [A-PHYSICAL] identification "spectral geometry = physical geometry" (Layer 2).

**Verification**: `spectral_metric_selection.py` (7/7 PASS)

### 2. Lorentz Signature Updates (completed from prior continuation)

THM_04AE Parts (e) and (f) established:
- 1+3 split from quaternion center: Z(H) = R = time, Im(H) = R^3 = space
- k=4 is the ONLY Frobenius-allowed rank giving Lorentzian spacetime

**Verification**: `spacetime_split_from_center.py` (6/6 PASS)

### 3. C*-Algebra Route to Quantum Mechanics [DERIVATION]

The observable algebra End_C(W) = M_2(C) is automatically a C*-algebra. This provides a third independent route to QM:

| Route | Input | Result | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| Geometric (THM_0491) | AXM_0100+0101+THM_0485 | Hilbert space | CANONICAL |
| Dynamical (THM_0494) | AXM_0117+0112 | Born rule via Wright-Fisher | DERIVATION |
| Algebraic (eval map) | THM_04AC+04AD+0485 | C*-algebra -> density matrices -> Born rule | DERIVATION |

Key observations:
- Self-adjoint elements of M_2(C) = observables (Herm(2))
- States = density matrices (positive, trace-1)
- Born rule from spectral decomposition: P(lambda_i) = Tr(P_i rho)
- Composition blindness forces superposition principle
- dim(state space) = 3 = dim(space) from 1+3 split — traceless Hermitian matrices parametrize both

**Verification**: `observable_algebra_cstar.py` (5/5 PASS)

## Scripts

| Script | Tests | Status | What it Verifies |
|--------|-------|--------|------------------|
| `spectral_metric_selection.py` | 7/7 | PASS | Cayley-Hamilton, gap, dynamics, causal structure, Hessian |

| `framework/investigations/meta/evaluation_map_foundations.md` | Modified | Added C*-algebra QM section; updated open questions; added 2 scripts to verification table; session history entries |
| `verification/sympy/spectral_metric_selection.py` | Created | 7 tests for spectral metric argument |
| `verification/sympy/observable_algebra_cstar.py` | Created | 5 tests for C*-algebra QM route |

## Open Questions

1. **Gauge structure from hidden space**: Hom(W^perp, W) = 28 = dim(so(8)) is at [CONJECTURE]. Can the breaking chain SO(7) -> G_2 -> SU(3) be formalized?
2. **Continuous parameter s**: The eval map doesn't resolve the continuous s gap in THM_0493
3. **Herm(2) = spacetime**: The identification of the observable algebra's self-adjoint part with spacetime events remains [A-PHYSICAL]
4. **Session numbering**: THM_04AC/04AD/04AE files reference "Session 188" from a continuation that predates this session; the actual creation session was a continuation that should have been registered separately

## Key Context for Next Session

The evaluation map chain is now comprehensive:
```
AXM_0115 -> THM_04AB (n_c=11)
  -> THM_04AC (perspectives exist, CANONICAL)
  -> THM_04AD (k in {1,4}, maximality -> k=4, DERIVATION)
  -> THM_04AE (Lorentz (1,3), 1+3 split, spectral metric, DERIVATION)
  -> C*-algebra route to QM (DERIVATION)
  -> Hidden space: SO(8) triality, gauge chain (CONJECTURE)
```

Total verification: 14 scripts, ~90 tests, all PASS.

The strongest results are: evaluation-induced perspective (CANONICAL, pure math), rank selection (DERIVATION, algebraic), Lorentz signature and spectral metric (DERIVATION, algebraic + dynamical), three-route QM convergence (DERIVATION).

The weakest links are: AXM_0115/0117 as axioms, the [A-PHYSICAL] identification of Herm(2) with spacetime, and the gauge breaking chain at [CONJECTURE].
