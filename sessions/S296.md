# Session S296

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: EQ-008: Structural origin of 11/3 = n_c/Im_H
**Topic**: Gauge (running couplings)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S295 (EQ-008 + EQ-011)

## Outcome

Four-direction investigation into whether the QCD gauge coefficient 11/3 can be structurally derived from the framework ratio n_c/Im_H. The paramagnetic-octonion correspondence (from S295) was formalized with full Fano plane analysis, upgrading the identity from ARITHMETIC to STRUCTURALLY MOTIVATED [CONJECTURE]. Three other approaches (Grassmannian curvature, Fano spectral analysis, Casimir chain) were explored and found to be dead ends or partial. The key structural insight is the unique 10/1 split: non-commutative Im(H)+Im(O)=10 vs commutative Im(C)=1, which maps to paramagnetic 10/3 vs diamagnetic 1/3.

## Key Findings

1. **Grassmannian curvature: DEAD END** [OBSERVATION]: The dual Coxeter remainder h*(SO(n)) - h*(SO(k)) - h*(SO(n-k)) = 2 is UNIVERSAL for all orthogonal Grassmannians, not special to Gr(4,11). The sigma model ratio h*/Im_H = Im_H is a Hurwitz tautology. Scalar curvature S = 126 = C_dim*Im_H^2*Im_O factors nicely but no ratio gives 11/3. Interesting factoid: S = 126 = S_EM from S297.

2. **Fano plane spectral: PARTIAL** [OBSERVATION]: Incidence matrix M^T*M eigenvalues = {9 (x1), 2 (x6)}. One eigenvalue Im_H = 3, six with |lambda|^2 = C_dim = 2, mirroring the commutative/non-commutative split. Associative 3-form: 42 = 2*dim(SO(7)) nonzero entries, 6 per unit = C_dim*Im_H. Associative/total 2-planes = 1/Im_H. Explains the 7/3 component of 11/3 but does not derive 11/3 itself.

3. **Casimir chain: DEAD END** [OBSERVATION]: Systematic scan of all Casimir ratios for SO(11), SO(7), SO(4), SU(3), SU(2), G_2 confirms n_c/Im_H is the ONLY non-circular route to 11/3. Dual Coxeter universality verified for 5 <= n <= 15. Hurwitz formula gives 11/3 only for n_d=4, which is the only allowed value.

4. **Paramagnetic-octonion correspondence: STRONGEST** [CONJECTURE]: The unique decomposition 11/3 = 10/3 + 1/3 = (non-commutative)/Im_H + (commutative)/Im_H physically maps paramagnetic anti-screening to non-commutativity (H,O -> SU(2),SU(3)) and diamagnetic screening to commutativity (C -> U(1)). Gap: normalization by Im_H = 3 spatial dimensions is [A-PHYSICAL].

5. **Cross-verification**: All four scripts + original S295 script pass. 64/64 new tests + 19/19 original = 83/83 total PASS.

6. **D=4 quadratic identity** [THEOREM, continuation]: (D-1)^2+1 = D(D+1)/2 holds ONLY at D=1 (trivial) and D=4. This means dim(Sym^2(R^D)) = (D-1)^2+1 uniquely at D=4, so the paramagnetic mode count 10 can be expressed BOTH as dim(Sym^2(R^4))/Im_H AND as Im_H+1/Im_H, but only in the quaternionic dimension.

7. **n_c = Im_H^2+2 from Cayley-Dickson** [THEOREM, continuation]: Using Im_O = 2*dim(H)-1 from doubling: n_c = 3n_d-1 and Im_H^2+2 = n_d^2-2n_d+3. Equal iff (n_d-1)(n_d-4)=0. So n_c = Im_H^2+2 is a structural consequence of Frobenius + doubling, not arithmetic luck.

8. **10/3 = S285 glueball intercept** [OBSERVATION, continuation]: The paramagnetic contribution 10/3 = Im_H+1/Im_H is the SAME number as the S285 large-N glueball 0++ intercept m(N=inf)/sqrt(sigma). Both probe pure-glue self-interaction physics (UV beta function vs IR bound state mass).

## Open Questions

1. **Normalization by Im_H** (EQ-008): WHY does each imaginary direction contribute exactly 1/Im_H to the gauge coefficient? This is the remaining gap between [CONJECTURE] and [DERIVATION].
2. **S = S_EM = 126**: The Grassmannian scalar curvature equals the total EM charge index from S297. Coincidence or connection? Likely metric-normalization dependent.
3. **Fano eigenvalue structure**: The {Im_H, C_dim^(x6)} pattern mirrors the commutative/non-commutative split. Could this be formalized?

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-008 status: 11/3 = n_c/Im_H upgraded to [CONJECTURE with structural support]. Key new results (continuation): (1) The quadratic identity (D-1)^2+1 = D(D+1)/2 holds ONLY at D=1,4 [THEOREM] -- the paramagnetic/Sym^2 coincidence is D=4-specific. (2) n_c = Im_H^2+2 follows from Cayley-Dickson + Frobenius [THEOREM] -- not arithmetic luck. (3) 10/3 = S285 large-N glueball intercept -- same number in UV (beta function) and IR (bound state mass). The gap is IRREDUCIBLE: QFT loop <-> division algebra mode identification requires [A-PHYSICAL]. Total: 94/94 PASS (5 scripts).
