# Session 254: CCP + Pipeline Framework Integration (Priority 3)

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Focus**: Propagate S251 foundational results through Priority 3 files (dark matter, spacetime, cosmology, quantum, constants, meta, plus remaining alpha files)
**Previous**: S253 (Priority 2 -- 9 files)
**Status**: COMPLETE (Priority 3)

---

## Outcome

Systematic propagation of AXM_0120 (CCP) across all Priority 3 files. Every [A-IMPORT] and [A-AXIOM] tag on n_c=11, n_d=4, F=C in the target investigation files has been upgraded to [D: CCP]. Open questions about deriving dimensions from axioms marked RESOLVED across 6 files. The associativity_derivation.md recommendation upgraded from "PARTIALLY DERIVED" to "DERIVED".

---

## Key Findings

1. **[PROPAGATION] 11 files updated across 7 directories**. Dark matter (2), spacetime (2), cosmology (2), quantum (1), constants (1), meta (1), alpha (2). All CCP-resolvable tags upgraded.

2. **[UPDATE] F=C status in measurement_problem_honest_assessment.md corrected**. The original "plausible but not forced" assessment for F=C is now outdated -- CCP forces F=C (maximal commutative division algebra with antisymmetry).

3. **[UPDATE] associativity_derivation.md recommendation upgraded**. "PARTIALLY DERIVED" -> "DERIVED (S251)". CCP provides the meta-axiom that closes the gap: forces all four division algebras, associativity filter gives n_d=4.

4. **[RESOLVED] 6 "derive dimensions" open questions closed**. In dark_sections_and_pi_formula (Q4), dimension_emergence (Q5.2), tilt_alpha_connection (Q1-Q2, Next Steps #1), alpha_137_session_34_notes (Q1-Q2), pi_derivation_attempt (Next Steps #1).

5. **[CLARIFICATION] Non-CCP tags correctly kept**. Pairwise characterization [A-STRUCTURAL], pair independence [A-STRUCTURAL], visibility model [SPECULATION], coupling structure assumptions -- all non-CCP and correctly untouched.

## Scripts

No new verification scripts this session (propagation-only work; no new calculations).

---

## Open Questions

1. **Priority 4 (publications)**: HONEST_ASSESSMENT, TECHNICAL_SUMMARY, THESIS need assumption count updates. Estimated 1 session.
2. **Priority 5 (topic files)**: topics/weinberg-angle.md, topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md, etc. May have stale "imported" language.
3. **Remaining non-CCP [A-STRUCTURAL] tags**: ~20+ across investigation files. These are genuinely non-CCP-resolvable (pairwise characterization, pair independence, visibility models, coupling structure, democratic counting, physical identifications).

---

## Key Context for Next Session

S254 completed Priority 3 propagation. Combined with S252 (P1, 13 files) and S253 (P2, 9 files), the total is **33 files updated** across the framework. The remaining CCP-relevant updates are in publications (Priority 4) and topic files (Priority 5). The framework's remaining irreducible assumptions are: (1) [A-COUPLING] (gauge coupling scaling), (2) [A-PHYSICAL] identifications (interface=1/alpha, generations=Im(H)), (3) linear coupling form [A-STRUCTURAL], (4) |Pi| unconstrained, (5) democratic counting [A-STRUCTURAL].
