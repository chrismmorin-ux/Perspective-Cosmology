# Session 175 — EWSB from Tilt Matrix Off-Diagonal Block

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Focus**: Resolve S174 EWSB problem — derive 3 massive bosons from epsilon_di Higgs doublet
**Topic**: Collider/crystallization (symmetry breaking chain)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S174 (full SM gauge group, EWSB open: 2 massive bosons instead of 3)

---

## Outcome

The S174 EWSB problem is **RESOLVED**. The adjoint VEV (epsilon_dd, the 4x4 defect block) only breaks 2 generators, giving 2 massive bosons. The correct Higgs mechanism uses the **off-diagonal block** epsilon_di (4x7 = 28 modes), which contains an SU(2)_L doublet with exactly the SM Higgs quantum numbers.

A VEV in this doublet breaks SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y -> U(1)_EM, giving 3 massive bosons (W+, W-, Z) + 1 massless (photon) + 1 physical Higgs scalar.

The Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) from the global SO(11) breaking.

## Key Findings

### F1: epsilon_di contains SM Higgs quantum numbers [DERIVATION]

The 4x7 off-diagonal block of the tilt matrix decomposes under SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y x SU(3)_c as:
- (2, 3)_{-1} + conjugate: 12 real DOF [colored]
- (2, 3bar)_{-1} + conjugate: 12 real DOF [colored]
- **(2, 1)_{Y=1/2} + conjugate: 4 real DOF [HIGGS]**

Total: 12 + 12 + 4 = 28 = n_d x Im_O. Verified: T13-T16 PASS.

**Chain**: 4 of SO(4) -> (2,2) under SU(2)_+ x SU(2)_- [I-MATH]; after J breaks SU(2)_+ -> U(1)_J: (2,2) -> (2)_{-1} + (2bar)_{+1} [D]; 7 of G2 -> 3 + 3bar + 1 under SU(3) [I-MATH]; tensor product gives full decomposition [D].

### F2: Hypercharge Y = 1/2 from U(1)_J normalization [DERIVATION]

The U(1)_J charge of the doublet is -1. With normalization Y = -J_charge/2, the Higgs gets Y = +1/2, matching the SM. Electric charges: Q = T3 + Y gives (+1, 0) = (H+, H0). Verified: T17-T20 PASS.

### F3: Doublet VEV gives 3 massive + 1 massless [DERIVATION]

VEV = (0, v) in the doublet:
- T1 * vev != 0: BROKEN (W bosons)
- T3 * vev != 0: BROKEN (neutral current)
- Q_EM * vev = 0: PRESERVED (photon)
- 3 broken generators (W+, W-, Z) + 1 unbroken (photon)

Physical Higgs: 4 real DOF - 3 eaten = 1 scalar. Verified: T21-T25 PASS.

### F4: S174 problem resolved — off-diagonal, not diagonal [DERIVATION]

- S174 adjoint VEV (epsilon_dd): breaks em2, em3 -> 2 massive bosons
- S175 doublet VEV (epsilon_di): breaks T1, T2, Z-combination -> 3 massive bosons

The fix is using the off-diagonal sector connecting defect and internal spaces. Verified: T26-T28 PASS.

### F5: Higgs is a pseudo-NGB from global SO(11) [CONJECTURE]

The 28 epsilon_di modes are Stage 1 Goldstones from SO(11) -> SO(4) x SO(7). Since SO(11) is a GLOBAL crystal symmetry [AXM_0112] and only the SM gauge group (dim 12) is local, these 28 modes are physical pNGBs. The Higgs doublet (4 DOF) gets a potential from SM gauge loops (Coleman-Weinberg mechanism). The 24 colored modes get larger masses from QCD loops.

After EWSB: 1 Higgs + 24 colored pNGBs = 25 physical scalars from Stage 1.

**Gap**: pNGB mass generation from CW mechanism not computed this session.

### F6: Notable structural relationships [DERIVATION]

- Higgs DOF = 4 = n_d = dim(H)
- Singlet fraction of Stage 1 Goldstones: 4/28 = 1/Im_O
- Full breaking chain now has 5 stages (4 crystal + 1 EWSB)
- Total Goldstones: 28 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 43, 3 eaten by EWSB

Verified: T29-T32 PASS.

## Open Questions

1. **Coleman-Weinberg potential**: The pNGB Higgs doublet needs a potential from SM gauge loops to get its mass. This is a standard calculation in composite Higgs models but hasn't been done within the framework. Can the framework predict m_H?

2. **Colored pNGB masses**: The 24 colored modes should get masses from QCD loops. Are these heavy enough to avoid collider bounds? Standard composite Higgs models typically need colored pNGBs above ~1 TeV.

3. **Two Higgs doublets vs one**: The framework has (2,1)_{-1} and its conjugate (2bar,1)_{+1}. For a REAL tilt matrix these form one doublet (4 real DOF). If the tilt matrix were complex, we'd get two doublets (8 real DOF, like a 2HDM). Which applies?

4. **Hypercharge normalization**: Y = -J_charge/2 matches SM assignments for the Higgs. Does it correctly assign hypercharges to all SM fermions? (Requires embedding fermions in SO(11) representations.)

5. **Stage 1 Goldstone dynamics**: The 28 pNGBs decompose as 4 (Higgs) + 24 (colored). Are the colored modes observable? Do they contribute to precision electroweak tests?

## Key Context for Next Session

The full electroweak symmetry breaking chain is now complete:

```
SO(11) -> SO(4) x SO(7) -> SO(4) x G2 -> SO(4) x SU(3) -> U(2) x SU(3) -> U(1)_EM x SU(3)
          28 Gold           7 Gold        6 Gold (F=C)     2 Gold (F=C)    3 eaten (EWSB)
```

The Higgs is a Stage 1 Goldstone (pNGB of global SO(11)). This is structurally identical to composite Higgs models. The main open directions are: (a) compute the CW potential for Higgs mass prediction, (b) check colored pNGB phenomenology, (c) verify hypercharge assignments for fermions.
