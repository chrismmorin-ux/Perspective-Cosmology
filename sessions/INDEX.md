| 220 | 2026-02-03 | QCD string tension lattice validation (EQ-014) | **Data insufficient**: Knechtli 445(7) MeV consistent (1σ), TUMQCD 467 in tension (5.5%). Two groups disagree by 5%. Framework 441.5 MeV not confirmed or falsified. | `sessions/S220.md` |
| 218 | 2026-02-03 | Weinberg: SU(3) mode counting test | **N_charged=94 FAILS** for α_s, only dim(SU(3))=8 works. **Structural theorem T_SU2=T_SU3=22**: one-loop gives α₂=α₃ (WRONG). α₃/α₂=7/2 at 0.34%. Gap refined to "why two regimes?" 1 script, 15/15 PASS. | `sessions/S218.md` |
| 217 | 2026-02-03 | Mass scale f: democratic bilinear (EQ-020) | **Democratic Bilinear Principle**: xi=4/121 and sin^2(theta_W)=28/121 unified as fractions of dim(End(V))=121.
