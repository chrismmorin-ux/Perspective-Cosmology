| # | Date | Topic | Key Result |
|---|------|-------|------------|
| 322 | 2026-02-09 | Scalar channel DM + generation questions | **DM = scalar channel color singlet** [CONJECTURE]: Hom(R,R^7) provides DM identity. H-parity (quaternion conjugation Z_2) stabilizes DM [DERIVATION]. 1+3=n_d unification (1 dark + 3 generations). **21=dim(so(7)) is STRUCTURAL** [THEOREM via Cayley-Dickson]. Mass hierarchy NEGATIVE: SO(3) gives ordering not magnitude. EQ-043 partially resolved. 100/100 PASS (3 scripts) |
| 321 | 2026-02-09 | Generation mechanism formalization | **IRA-09 RESOLVED** via Hom(H,R^7) decomposition [DERIVATION]. 3 independent R^7 channels from Im(H)=3, Weinberg-forced. Three complementary mechanisms (C: Hom decomposition, D: complex structure selection, A: SO(3) generation symmetry). No new IRA needed, count unchanged at 4. Scalar channel (R c H) open question. 37/37 PASS (1 script: `generation_mechanism_formalization.py`) |
| 320 | 2026-02-08 | DM-3b: Spinor gap -> SU(3) CORRECTION | **SU(3) c G_2 = color, not generation** [DERIVATION, 3 independent arguments]. IRA-09 (S299) resolution RETRACTED. Lepton test decisive: SU(3) singlets need 3 gens separately. S319 "8 dark states" RETRACTED. S320 Phase 1 (B-D portal, triality) RETRACTED. Spinor 32 = 1 full SM gen, no dark states. DM mass/coupling/Omega survive. DM particle identity REOPENED. 24/24 PASS (1 script: `spinor_gap_su3_analysis.py`) |

| 316 | 2026-02-08 | DM sigma_SI prediction | **Standard Higgs portal EXCLUDED** by LHC: BR(h->inv)=51% (limit 11%). DM-Higgs coupling must be suppressed by 3x+. Max sigma_SI < 8.2e-47 cm^2 (below Xe nu floor). DM mass mechanism differs from SM fermions [DERIVATION]. 22/22 PASS (1 script) |
| 315 | 2026-02-08 | EQ-013: Exponent derivation | **Exponent n_d DERIVED** from det(M) on End(R^n_d) [DERIVATION, 1 A-STRUCTURAL]. Trace/det unification: Tr(M)->Weinberg coeff n_d, det(M)->DM mass (n_c-1)^n_d. Same matrix, two invariants. EQ-013 FULLY RESOLVED. 22/22 PASS (1 script) |
| 314 | 2026-02-08 | EQ-013: DM mass formula selection | **Formula C = PRIMARY** (m_e*(n_c-1)^n_d=5.11 GeV, weakness 0).
