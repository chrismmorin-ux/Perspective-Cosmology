|---|------|-------|---------|------|
| 258 | 2026-02-07 | Attack Irreducible Assumptions (CONJ-A3 + B3) | **CONJ-A3 PROVEN**: Step 5 independence [A-STRUCTURAL] -> [DERIVED from CCP + Radon-Hurwitz]. Root: complement dim 7 is odd -> no [4,7,7]-composition -> cross-terms vanish -> independence forced. **CONJ-B3 partially resolved**: gradient flow convergence [THEOREM], B3 [A-PHYSICAL] -> [CONJECTURE]. Bonus: Hurwitz dims = CNH norms. 39/39 PASS (2 scripts). | `sessions/S258.md` |
| 257 | 2026-02-07 | Red Team v2.0 + LLM Challenge v2 | **Red Team updated** (S120->S257): 20-35% genuine physics (from 15-30%). 3/8 original criticisms RESOLVED, 5 new identified. **LLM Challenge v2**: 15/18 PASS — structural derivations confirmed reproducible. Prior v1 (S128-135) discovered: 3/4 SUCCESS. Numerical formula discovery remains untested. | `sessions/S257.md` |
| 256 | 2026-02-07 | Irreducible Assumptions + Mathematical Periodic Table | **Periodic Table v2.0 built**: 10-group classification of all ~54 framework math objects. 13 post-CCP irreducible assumptions inventoried (5 [A-STRUCTURAL], 7 [A-PHYSICAL], 1 [A-COUPLING]). 5 precise conjectures formulated (CONJ-A1 through CONJ-B3). CONJ-A3 (algebraic incompatibility) identified as most tractable. | `sessions/S256.md` |
| 255 | 2026-02-06 | CCP Framework Integration (P4+P5) | **Priorities 4+5 COMPLETE / CCP PROJECT DONE**: 7 files (5 publications + PHYSICIST_SUMMARY + CLAUDE.md). Assumption count ~3->~2 everywhere.

| 251 | 2026-02-06 | CCP + Pipeline + Generations | **AXM_0120 (CCP) formalized**: perfection = maximal consistency, forces n_c=11, F=C, n_d=4. **Pipeline derives SM gauge group**: 121->55->18->12 = u(1)xsu(2)xsu(3). **Generation count = 3**: from Im(H) x (7->3+3-bar+1), one [A-PHYSICAL] step. 67/67 PASS (3 scripts). Foundational shift — propagation needed framework-wide. | `sessions/S251.md` |
| 250 | 2026-02-06 | CNH Catalog Reassessment | Norm/non-norm classification of 99 entries: NORM=11, NON-NORM=16, BRIDGE=29. #62 Li-7 R->C. 20/20 PASS. Catalog v4.3. | `sessions/S250.md` |
| 249 | 2026-02-06 | CNH Phase 3: Adoption Path + Im(H) Derivation | **No alternate prediction paths** for criterion #4: CCF vs binding energy r=-0.15, magic numbers FAIL (28,126 are non-norms but magic), CNO no pattern, particle QNs trivially norms. Im(H)=3 connection IRREDUCIBLE GAP (requires [I-PHYSICS]). CNH specific to BBN. 56/56 PASS (3 scripts). CNH suite total: 121/121. | `sessions/S249.md` |
| 248 | 2026-02-03 | CNH Phase 2: Denominator + Selection Rule | **CCF denominator RESOLVED** [DERIVATION]: multiplicative-vs-additive independence forces 3 independent norm channels. He-3 test BLOCKED (PDG: inappropriate probe). Norm/non-norm selection rule classified (19 formulas, suggestive not predictive). EQ-002 classified as non-norm/norm. AXM_0118 criterion #5 cleared. 26/26 PASS. | `sessions/S248.md` |
| 246 | 2026-02-03 | CNH Deep Investigation | **1/3 factor DERIVED** (CCF + ideal counting, 22/22 PASS). Bridge pattern: 5/8 D_fw primes bridge norm/non-norm sectors. Extended primes 97 (pure-norm) and 109 (bridge) understood. EQ-002/003 follow non-norm/norm pattern. CNH formalized as proposed AXM_0118 revision. | `sessions/S246.md` |
| 247 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: Gravitational Scattering (Gap Analysis Session C) | 5 DERIVATION GAP entries R→C (#29-32 grav scattering; #79 binary inspiral). n_d=4 → EFE via Lovelock chain verified. Grav scattering 0%→100%, grav waves 50%→75%. **Gap Analysis A+B+C COMPLETE**: 18 upgrades, **3D/54C/42R** (54.5%). 1 script (21/21 PASS). Catalog v4.2 (65 scripts, 844 tests). | `sessions/S247.md` |
| 245 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: QCD Phase + EW Baryogenesis (Gap Analysis Session B) | 4 DERIVATION GAP entries R→C (#51,52,54 QCD phase; #67 EW baryogenesis). N_c=3 antisym=anti-fund uniqueness theorem. EW baryogenesis ruled out (v_c/T_c ~ 0.14). Tag distribution 3D/45C/51R → **3D/49C/47R**. 2 scripts (39/39 PASS). Catalog v4.1 (64 scripts, 823 tests). | `sessions/S245.md` |
| 244 | 2026-02-03 | Gaussian Norm Unification (CNH) | **AXM_0118 and Li-7 ARE the same principle.** Gaussian norm N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2 from Z[i] exactly separates D_framework: {1,2,4,8}=norms, {3,7,11}=non-norms. THEOREM (not pattern). C is unique (R too restrictive, H/O too permissive). BBN catalog Li-7 entry fixed. 1 new script (17/17 PASS). | `sessions/S244.md` |
| ... | Earlier | See `session_log.md` or individual `sessions/S{N}.md` files | | |
| 242 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: Phase 8b actioning | 5 re-tags (GW→C, Higgs→C, jets→C, Bhabha/Moller dual-tag resolved), DM mass discrepancy: 3 competing formulas (not units error), 2 new scattering scripts (Bhabha 8/8, Moller 8/8). Catalog v3.9 (61 scripts, 749 tests, 3D/36C/60R). | `sessions/S242.md` |
| 241 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: Phase 8 meta-analysis | 6-agent parallel extraction of all 99 entries. Tag distribution: 3D (3%), 34C (34%), 62R (63%). Created SUMMARY.md + TAG_INDEX.md. 12 inconsistencies flagged. Top priorities: DM mass (EQ-013), r ambiguity (EQ-032), Omega_m (EQ-002). | `sessions/S241.md` |
| 240 | 2026-02-03 | EQ-012: Crossed Casimir first-principles derivation | Sign DERIVED (Killing form of gl(3,R): compact→positive, non-compact→negative). Magnitude |w_l|=C_2(complementary) remains [CONJECTURE]. Constraint system {w_0=1, sum=9, Frobenius=129, product=-12} uniquely selects formula, but 2/4 constraints conjectural. 1 script, 13/13 PASS. | `sessions/S240.md` |
| ... | Earlier | See `session_log.md` or individual `sessions/S{N}.md` files | | |
| 234 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: Phase 6 cosmological | 4 cosmological sub-catalog files (13 processes), 1 new script (16/16 PASS). 2/13 [FRAMEWORK-DERIVED] (inflation, perturbations), 4/13 [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED], 7/13 [STANDARD-RELABELED]. DM mass formula discrepancy flagged. F-10 resolution documented. Catalog v3.6 (58 scripts, 723 tests). | `sessions/S234.md` |
| 233 | 2026-02-03 | Weinberg: Step 6 adoption + deeper derivation | **I-STRUCT-5 adopted** [A-PHYSICAL]. EQ-007/004/020/022 resolved. RG deficit (0.36%) naturally sized (~α_s/(4π)). Top partners/pNGBs worsen deficit. Non-perturbative matching natural. 4 deeper derivation candidates: full compositeness (Weinberg SRs) most promising. 2 scripts, 27/27 PASS. | `sessions/S233.md` |
| ... | Earlier | See `session_log.md` or individual `sessions/S{N}.md` files | | |
| 230 | 2026-02-03 | CC wrong sign (F-10): sign convention resolution | **F-10 RESOLVED**: Sign convention error — V<0 gives Λ>0 via standard GR (Λ = -8πG·V). Gravity grade D+ → C-. EQ-005 resolved, EQ-002 unblocked. 1 script (10/10 PASS). ~20 files updated. Magnitude gap (~10^111) remains. | `sessions/S230.md` |
| 229 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: Phase 4 phase transitions | **C7 fleshed out**, 3 phase transition sub-catalog files (12 processes), 1 new script (16/16 PASS). EWSB 1 [FRAMEWORK-DERIVED] + 3 [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (xi=4/121, sin^2=28/121, kappa_V). QCD 4/4 [STANDARD-RELABELED]. BBN 2/4 [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (N_nu=3). Catalog v3.4 (56 scripts, 695 tests). | `sessions/S229.md` |
| 228 | 2026-02-03 | Weinberg: emergent coupling + RG matching | **Step 6 [A-PHYSICAL] irreducible**: three mechanisms give 28/7/21 (democratic/Dynkin/curvature), only democratic matches. Democratic/Dynkin = n_d = 4. C_L = 21 = Im_O×Im_H new. RG tension real (Λ₂/Λ₃ = 15:1) but BSM deficit only 0.36%. Colored pNGBs worsen tension. κ=1 subordinate to Step 6. 2 scripts, 32/32 PASS. | `sessions/S228.md` |
| 227 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: Phase 3 bound states | **C12/C13 fleshed out**, 2 bound state sub-catalog files (10 processes), 1 new script (16/16 PASS). Hadron formation 4/6 [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (N_c = Im_H). Nuclear binding 4/4 [STANDARD-RELABELED]. Catalog v3.3 (55 scripts, 679 tests). | `sessions/S227.md` |
| 226 | 2026-02-03 | Cyclotomic 43: numerator stress test (EQ-012) | **D=43 UNIQUE** (1/199 dual-fit scan). Phi_6 unique among cyclotomics and monic quadratics. **S211 uniqueness corrected** (two-point test restores it). Numerator sum rules {1^2,2^2,3^2} discovered [CONJECTURE]. Hidden sum tautological (O+1=9). Numerators post-hoc (no mechanism). 2 scripts, 19/20 PASS. | `sessions/S226.md` |
| 225 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: Phase 2 scattering | **C11 fleshed out**, 2 scattering sub-catalog files (9 processes), 1 new script (15/15 PASS). R-ratio [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (N_c = Im_H). EM scattering mostly [STANDARD-RELABELED]. Catalog v3.2 (54 scripts, 663 tests). | `sessions/S225.md` |
| 224 | 2026-02-03 | Democratic counting: Schur's lemma resolution | **Democratic metric from irreducibility** [DERIVATION]. Tangent space Hom(R⁴,R⁷) irreducible under SO(4)×SO(7) → Schur's lemma → unique invariant metric → all 28 equal. Dynkin weighting excluded. Gap narrowed to [A-PHYSICAL]: emergent gauge coupling. RG tension documented (Λ₂≈2100 vs Λ₃≈140 GeV). 1 script, 21/21 PASS. | `sessions/S224.md` |
| 223 | 2026-02-03 | Crystallization Catalog: Phase 1 EW decays | **C10 fleshed out**, 2 sub-catalog files (9 processes), 2 new scripts (32/32 PASS). Weak decays majority [STANDARD-RELABELED], Z/W [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED]. CKM gap remains. Catalog v3.1. | `sessions/S223.md` |
| 222 | 2026-02-03 | Weinberg: two-regime structural theorem | **T_fund=1** [DERIVATION] from division algebra minimality. **Singlet criterion** [CONJECTURE]: 0 singlets in R⁴ → interface (N=28), 1 singlet in R⁷ → internal (N=8). Root cause: H associative vs O non-associative. Gap refined to "why democratic counting?" 1 script, 18/18 PASS. | `sessions/S222.md` |
| 220 | 2026-02-03 | QCD string tension lattice validation (EQ-014) | **Data insufficient**: Knechtli 445(7) MeV consistent (1σ), TUMQCD 467 in tension (5.5%). Two groups disagree by 5%. Framework 441.5 MeV not confirmed or falsified. | `sessions/S220.md` |
| ... | Earlier | See `session_log.md` or individual `sessions/S{N}.md` files | | |
