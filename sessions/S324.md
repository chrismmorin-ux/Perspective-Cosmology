# Session S324: Publication Propagation Sync (Housekeeping)

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Sync all publication files for stale propagation items
**Topic**: Housekeeping / propagation
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S323 (H-parity + dark quarks + SO(8) triality)

---

## Outcome

Pure housekeeping session. Fixed remaining stale references across 5 publication files. No new physics, no new scripts. All edits verified by grep — zero stale hits remaining.

---

## Edits Made

### 1. THESIS.md (v2.4 -> unchanged version, 1 fix)
- Line 185: "~689 verification scripts" -> "~713 verification scripts"

### 2. TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md (v2.4 -> v2.5)
- Section 13.3 IRA table: 6 entries -> 4 (removed IRA-01 [RESOLVED S304], IRA-10 [RESOLVED S302], renamed I-STRUCT-5 -> IRA-11)
- Updated section title from "(S299)" to "(S304)"
- Updated resolution note: 5 former conjectures -> 7 former assumptions resolved
- Version bump + revision history entry

### 3. PLAIN_LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION.md (v2.4 -> v2.5)
- Line 145: "~2 structural assumptions" -> "4 irreducible assumptions (1 structural, 2 physical, 1 import)"
- Version bump + revision history entry

### 4. OBJECTIONS_AND_RESPONSES.md (v2.2 -> v2.4)
- 4 instances of "~2 structural assumptions" updated to "4 irreducible assumptions"
- Alpha Step 5 status: [CONJECTURE] -> [A-STRUCTURAL within I-STRUCT-5] (S297)
- "~3 structural assumptions" -> "4 irreducible assumptions" in Objection 4
- Summary table row updated
- Version bump v2.2 -> v2.4, added v2.3/v2.4 revision history

### 5. PROPAGATION_MANIFEST.md
- PROP-001 (IRA count): ACTIVE -> COMPLETE
- PROP-010 (script count): ACTIVE -> COMPLETE
- Updated "Known current" lists

### Already done (confirmed S322):
- S319.md errata block (dark sector counting RETRACTED) ✓
- S317.md errata block (0.7% -> 1.5%) ✓
- PROP-021/022/023 already created ✓
- HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md already at v2.4 with correct counts ✓

---

## Verification

Final grep of `publications/` for stale patterns:
- "6 irreducible": **0 hits** ✓
- "~548 scripts": **0 hits** ✓
- "~689": **0 hits** ✓
- "~2 structural" (body text): **0 hits** (only in revision history describing changes) ✓
- "IRA-01 [A-STRUCTURAL]" (active table): **0 hits** ✓
- "IRA-10" (active table): **0 hits** (only in revision history and resolution notes) ✓

## Scripts

None (housekeeping session).

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `publications/THESIS.md` | Script count ~689 -> ~713 |
| `publications/TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md` | IRA table 6->4, version v2.5 |
| `publications/PLAIN_LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION.md` | Assumption count, version v2.5 |
| `publications/OBJECTIONS_AND_RESPONSES.md` | 4x assumption count, Step 5 status, version v2.4 |
| `registry/PROPAGATION_MANIFEST.md` | PROP-001/010 -> COMPLETE |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | S324 registered/deregistered |

## Open Questions

None. All propagation items addressed.

## Key Context for Next Session

All publication files are now synchronized with framework state as of S323. PROP-001 (IRA count) and PROP-010 (script count) are COMPLETE. OBJECTIONS_AND_RESPONSES.md was 2 versions behind and is now current. No remaining stale propagation items in publications/.
