# Session 192 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: Phase 5: Cosmology Cleanup — Honest assessment of all cosmological derivations
**Topic**: Cosmology audit (multi-section in `registry/derivations_summary.md`)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S191 (CMB synthesis), S190 (Phase 4D collider audit)
**Next**: Phase 6 (Gravity Assessment) or Phase 7 (Statistical Validation)

## Outcome

Comprehensive S192 audit of all 11 cosmology-related sections in derivations_summary.md. Every section downgraded from DERIVATION/STRONG DERIVATION to [CONJECTURE] or [HYBRID] with detailed per-formula assumption chains. Pattern confirmed: ALL cosmological formulas are post-hoc numerical matches of framework quantities to known Planck/BBN/SH0ES values. Two genuinely strong items identified: m_DM = 5.11 GeV (blind prediction) and r = 0.035 (testable consequence of searched μ²).

## Key Findings

1. **[DOWNGRADED] Cosmological parameters (1.11)**: Ω_Λ = 13/19, Ω_m = 6/19, Ω_DM/Ω_b = 49/9 — all post-hoc ratio matching. Grade C-. No mechanism connects framework integers to density fractions.

2. **[PARTIALLY DOWNGRADED] Dark matter (1.12)**: SU(7) × U(1)_dark structure is [CONJECTURE], but m_DM = 5.11 GeV locked as blind prediction before SuperCDMS sensitivity window. Grade C+. Best blind prediction in the framework.

3. **[DOWNGRADED] BBN (1.14)**: All 5 formulas (Y_p, D/H, Li-7, η, T_EW/T_QCD) are post-hoc matches. Coefficient decompositions (10/21, 3/14, etc.) assigned AFTER numerical agreement. 0.38-0.40% uniform accuracy is suspiciously consistent. Grade C-.

4. **[DOWNGRADED] Hubble constant (1.16)**: H/M_Pl = α^28 × √(19/3003) constructed to match Planck. Tension ratio 13/12 found after both values known. Two competing H₀ formulas (337/5 vs α^28 formula) is a RED FLAG. Grade D+.

5. **[RECLASSIFIED] Inflation (1.22)**: μ² = 1536/7 was SEARCHED (not derived). n_s = 193/200 is [CONJECTURE]. However, r = 7/200 = 0.035 follows with no additional freedom → genuine testable prediction. w = -1 at risk from DESI. Grade C+.

6. **[DOWNGRADED] Acoustic scale (1.23)**: l_A = 96π and r_s = 337 × 3/7 both post-hoc. S191 proved c_s = 3/7 NOT derivable (all 4 paths fail). Sound horizon is a precision illusion. Grade C-.

7. **[RECLASSIFIED] Power spectrum/secondary/polarization/blind predictions (1.24-1.27)**: All reclassified as [HYBRID] — framework provides parameter values [CONJECTURE], standard Boltzmann/LCDM physics provides dynamics [A-IMPORT].

8. **Phase 5 overall grade: C-**. Genuine strengths: r = 0.035, m_DM = 5.11 GeV, internally consistent parameter set. Weaknesses: everything else is post-hoc numerical matching.

|------|--------|
| `registry/derivations_summary.md` | S192 audit on 11 cosmology sections (1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.16, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, 1.27). Phase 5 summary table. Remaining gaps updated. |
| `sessions/INDEX.md` | Added S192 |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | Registered/deregistered S192 |

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Phase 6 (Gravity)**: Einstein equations (1.17) are tagged DERIVED but likely need similar downgrade. Coset sigma model at SKETCH level.
2. **Phase 7 (Statistics)**: Formula search documentation for every sub-percent match. LLM Derivation Challenge needs external LLMs.
3. **Phase 8 (Falsification)**: Update FALSIFICATION_REGISTRY.md with downgraded confidence levels from Phase 5.
4. **Two H₀ formulas**: 337/5 and α^28 × √(19/3003) both match Planck — should one be deprecated?
5. **DESI Y3**: If w ≠ -1 at >3σ, framework takes significant falsification hit.

## Key Context for Next Session

The Phase 5 cosmology audit reveals the same pattern found in Phase 4: the framework excels at structural/algebraic relationships (gauge groups, spacetime dimensions) but its numerical predictions for cosmological parameters are post-hoc matches. The two genuinely predictive items are m_DM = 5.11 GeV (blind, waiting for SuperCDMS) and r = 0.035 (CMB-S4 by ~2028). The overall grade dropped from the previously inflated "STRONG DERIVATION" to an honest C-. Phase 6 (Gravity) should be next — the plan estimates "C- at best" and this needs documenting.
