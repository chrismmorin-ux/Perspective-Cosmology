# Session S323: H-Parity Absolute Stability + Dark Quarks + SO(8) Triality

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Three threads from S322: H-parity conservation depth, dark quarks, SO(8) triality
**Topic**: Generation structure / dark matter
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S322 (scalar channel DM identity)

---

## Outcome

All three threads investigated. H-parity is proven EXACT [THEOREM] via the First Fundamental Theorem for SO(4) + Euler parity -- DM is absolutely stable. Dark quarks (colored scalar channel components) are characterized as ~TeV colored scalars that pair-annihilate away cosmologically [CONJECTURE]. SO(8) triality is broken by the framework's identity choice in O, with the residual Z_2 identified as charge conjugation. 73/73 PASS across 3 new scripts.

## Key Findings

1. **H-parity is EXACT** [THEOREM]: Two independent protections against DM decay:
   - **FFT argument**: SO(4)-invariants on Hom(R^4, R^7) are generated by G = eps^T eps (Gram matrix). All invariants have EVEN degree in eps. No cubic/quintic/etc. vertices exist.
   - **Euler parity + H-parity**: In any Feynman diagram, total external legs = EVEN. For DM decay to k fermions: Euler requires k=odd, H-parity (-1)^k requires k=even. Contradictory for all k.
   - **No anomaly**: Charge sum = 7 - 21 = -14 (even). No Z_2 gauge anomaly.
   - **No explicit breaking**: Pre-SSB SO(4) invariance descends to exact H-parity post-SSB.
   - **No spontaneous breaking**: Vacuum has <eps_a> = 0.
   - **Consequence**: DM absolutely stable (tau = infinity). Stronger than SUSY R-parity.
   - Chain: CCP -> H -> conjugation -> FFT for SO(4) -> even-degree -> Euler parity -> absolute stability. 0 [A-PHYSICAL], 0 conjectures.

2. **Dark quarks characterized** [CONJECTURE]: The 3+3bar from R^7 = 3+3bar+1 under G_2 -> SU(3) are colored scalars (spin-0):
   - SU(2)_L singlets (R c H is SU(2)_L invariant)
   - H-parity +1 (same as DM, from R c H)
   - Single decay FORBIDDEN (color + spin conservation -- no color-changing vertex)
   - Mass ~ O(f) ~ 1.35 TeV from G_2 -> SU(3) breaking [CONJECTURE]
   - Pair-annihilate via QCD: DQ + anti-DQ -> gg, qqbar (efficient)
   - Cosmologically negligible: annihilate away, only color-singlet DM survives
   - LHC: pair production at ~TeV. Signature: dark meson -> dijet resonance.

3. **SO(8) triality analysis** [DERIVATION]: The 28 = dim(Hom(H,R^7)) = dim(adj SO(8)):
   - Identity: n_d * Im_O = dim_O*(dim_O-1)/2 reduces to 2*n_d = dim_O (CD doubling)
   - Three triality-related SO(7) embeddings in SO(8); framework selects vector embedding
   - Choosing 1 in O breaks S_3 (triality) -> Z_2 (charge conjugation = 8_s <-> 8_c)
   - G_2 = intersection of all three SO(7)'s; triality invisible at G_2 level
   - Full branching: 28 -> (7+21) -> (7+14+7) -> 8 + 3*(3+3bar) + 2*1 under SU(3)
   - H-parity (domain: SO(4)) and triality (codomain: SO(8)) are INDEPENDENT symmetries
   - Triality explains WHY dimensions work but is BROKEN in the physical theory

## Open Questions

1. **Dark quark EW quantum numbers** (NEW): Hypercharge Y of the 3 in the 7 of G_2 under the SM embedding -- needed for precise LHC phenomenology
2. **Dark quark LHC signature** (NEW): Can pair-produced dark mesons be distinguished from standard dijet resonances? What's the cross-section at HL-LHC?
3. **Triality companion 7**: The second 7 in the G_2 decomposition (28 -> 7+14+7) -- what's its physical role inside the generation channels?
4. **Koide formula** (EQ-NEW): Can the 2/3 ratio be derived from S^2 = SO(3)/U(1) geometry? [SPECULATION]
5. **CKM/PMNS**: Can mixing matrices be derived from SO(3)_family breaking?
6. **n_DM = n_baryon quantitative** (EQ-043 remaining): Derive the equality from SO(11) strong dynamics

## Key Context for Next Session

S323 established absolute DM stability [THEOREM] via two independent mechanisms (FFT even-degree theorem + H-parity/Euler parity contradiction). The dark quarks (colored scalars from the scalar channel) are at ~TeV scale, cosmologically negligible, with potential LHC signatures. SO(8) triality is broken in the physical theory but explains the structural 28 = 7+21 identity. The complete scalar channel picture is now: 7 = 1 (absolutely stable DM at 5.1 GeV) + 3+3bar (unstable colored scalars at ~TeV). Combined with S322, the generation+DM structure from Hom(H, R^7) is well-characterized. 73/73 PASS across 3 new scripts. Cumulative: 173/173 PASS for the generation/DM investigation (7 scripts).
