# Session S325: CKM/PMNS Mechanism + Dark Quark Hypercharge

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: CKM/PMNS from SO(3)_family breaking + dark quark EW quantum numbers
**Topic**: Generation structure / particles
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S323 (H-parity + dark quarks + SO(8) triality)

## Outcome

Two investigation threads advanced. CKM mixing mechanism IDENTIFIED [DERIVATION] via antisymmetric mass component misalignment in Im(H). CP violation structurally derived from quaternion non-commutativity (1 phase for 3 generations). Best numerical candidate for Cabibbo angle: lambda = 5/22 at 0.85% [SPECULATION]. Dark quark SU(2)_L singlet status confirmed [DERIVATION]. Hypercharge Y = 0 preferred [CONJECTURE] but precise value requires U(1)_Y embedding in SO(11) [OPEN]. 40/40 PASS across 2 new scripts.

## Key Findings

1. **CKM mechanism: antisymmetric mass misalignment** [DERIVATION]: Under SO(3)_family, the mass matrix in End(Im(H)) decomposes as 1+3+5. CKM mixing REQUIRES the vector (3) component (antisymmetric part) to point in DIFFERENT directions for up-type vs down-type quarks. If only 1+5 components present, V_CKM = I (trivial). The misalignment comes from SU(2)_L breaking by the Higgs VEV, mediated by vacuum angle xi = 4/121.

2. **CP violation = quaternion non-commutativity** [DERIVATION]: Im(H) = so(3) has [L_a, L_b] = epsilon_{abc} L_c. Quaternion conjugation reverses products: (pq)* = q*p*. Since pq != qp, CP is not a symmetry. For N = Im_H = 3 generations: (N-1)(N-2)/2 = 1 CP-violating phase. For 2 generations: 0 phases. PMNS: 1 Dirac + 2 Majorana = 3 phases.

3. **Cabibbo angle: best candidate lambda = 5/22** [SPECULATION]: lambda = (2/n_c)(1 + 1/n_d) = 5/22 = 0.2273 vs experimental 0.2254 (0.85% off, ~3 sigma). Decomposition: sqrt(xi) * (n_d+1)/n_d. The factor (n_d+1)/n_d may arise from partial compositeness correction. No simple expression matches to < 0.8%.

4. **Quark-lepton complementarity** [SPECULATION]: theta_12(PMNS) + theta_12(CKM) = 33.4 + 13.0 = 46.5 ~ 45 deg. Could reflect shared S^2 = SO(3)/U(1) geometry viewed from complementary reference frames.

5. **Dark quark SU(2)_L: singlet confirmed** [DERIVATION]: R c H is the custodial singlet in the (2,2) bifundamental of SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R. The epsilon_{ab} contraction is SU(2)_L invariant. Dark quarks are (1, 3, Y) under SU(2)_L x SU(3) x U(1)_Y.

6. **Dark quark hypercharge: Y = 0 preferred** [CONJECTURE]: Custodial singlet has no T_3R asymmetry -> Y = 0 most natural. DM neutrality requires Y(1) = 0 [DERIVATION]. Anomaly cancellation automatic for 3+3bar+1. Y = 0 scenario safe from LHC limits. Y = -1/3 scenario in marginal tension with R-hadron searches at 1.35 TeV.

7. **H-parity protects dark quarks for ALL Y** [THEOREM]: Even-degree theorem forbids single decay (DQ -> 2 fermions is degree 3 = odd). Only pair annihilation allowed. QCD pair annihilation efficient regardless of hypercharge.

## Open Questions

1. **Cabibbo angle derivation** (NEW): lambda = 5/22 at 0.85% is suggestive but not derived. The factor (n_d+1)/n_d = 5/4 needs structural explanation from composite sector dynamics.
2. **Full CKM matrix** (OPEN): Requires all 3 angles + 1 phase quantitatively. Depends on partial compositeness mixing parameters for each generation.
3. **PMNS matrix** (OPEN): Requires neutrino mass mechanism (Majorana vs Dirac). The quark-lepton complementarity suggests shared SO(3) origin.
4. **U(1)_Y embedding in SO(11)** (NEW): Which SO(11) generator is hypercharge? The pipeline gives u(1) c 12 = u(1)+su(2)+su(3), but not the explicit generator. This determines dark quark Y.
5. **Triality companion 7** (S323): Physical role of the second 7 in 28 -> 7+14+7 under G_2 -- still unexplored.
6. **Koide formula** (S322): Can 2/3 be derived from S^2 = SO(3)/U(1) geometry?
7. **Mass hierarchy** (S322): OPEN. Controls both mass ratios AND mixing angles via Gatto-Sartori-Tonin.

## Key Context for Next Session

S325 identified the CKM mixing mechanism [DERIVATION]: antisymmetric mass components (SO(3) vectors in Im(H)) for up and down quarks point in different directions, with misalignment from the Higgs VEV twist. CP violation is structural from quaternion non-commutativity [DERIVATION]. Best Cabibbo candidate lambda = 5/22 at 0.85% [SPECULATION]. Dark quark SU(2)_L singlet confirmed [DERIVATION], hypercharge Y = 0 preferred [CONJECTURE] but requires explicit U(1)_Y embedding in SO(11). Cumulative for generation/DM investigation: 213/213 PASS (9 scripts). The three highest-value open threads are: (1) mass hierarchy / Gatto-Sartori-Tonin (controls both masses AND mixing), (2) U(1)_Y embedding in SO(11) (determines dark quark phenomenology), (3) triality companion 7 (unexplored structural question).
