# Session 225: Crystallization Catalog Expansion -- Phase 2 Scattering Processes

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog Phase 2: scattering process sub-catalogs and R-ratio verification
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S223 (Phase 1 electroweak decays)

---

## Outcome

Phase 2 of the Crystallization Catalog expansion is complete. Two scattering sub-catalog files created: `electromagnetic_scattering.md` (5 processes: Compton, Bhabha, Moller, pair production, Thomson/Rayleigh) and `strong_scattering.md` (4 processes: R-ratio, DIS, Drell-Yan, jet production). One new verification script `r_ratio_crystallization.py` (15/15 PASS) verifying R = N_c * sum(Q_f^2) at all energy regimes with QCD corrections. C11 (Pair Creation/Annihilation) fleshed out from skeleton to full entry with 11 observables and sub-catalog references. C11 promoted from [STANDARD-RELABELED] to [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] for R-ratio processes. Catalog updated v3.1 -> v3.2 (54 scripts, 663 tests).

## Key Findings

1. **R-ratio from mode counting** [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED]: R = N_c * sum(Q_f^2) = {2, 10/3, 11/3, 5} for {3,4,5,6} active flavors. N_c = Im_H = 3 is the derived color factor. Born-level matches step structure exactly; NLO QCD corrections match data within 1-3% at all tested energies (2, 5, 10, 34 GeV). 15/15 PASS.

2. **b_0 = Im_O = 7 confirmed** [DERIVATION]: QCD beta function leading coefficient for N_f = 6 quarks matches Im_O exactly. Enters QCD corrections to R-ratio. Only N_f = {0, 3, 6} give integer b_0 values; N_f = 6 (full SM) gives Im_O = 7.

3. **R(5 flavors) = 11/3 = n_c/Im_H** [STANDARD-RELABELED]: Noted but flagged as KINEMATIC coincidence -- depends on m_t > M_Z/2, not on algebraic structure. Not promoted.

4. **EM scattering: honest assessment**: 4/5 EM scattering processes are [STANDARD-RELABELED]. Only pair production at the Z pole is [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (via sin^2 = 28/121 in forward-backward asymmetry). Compton, Bhabha, Moller, Thomson/Rayleigh are standard QED in crystallization language.

5. **Strong scattering: N_c dominant**: 3/4 strong scattering processes are [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (R-ratio, DIS sum rules, Drell-Yan color averaging all use N_c = Im_H directly). Jet production dynamics are [STANDARD-RELABELED] but color factors C_A/C_F = 9/4 encode N_c.

## Open Questions

1. **Quark charge derivation** (EQ-related): Quark charges Q_f remain entirely [A-IMPORT]. Deriving even the charge quantization (Q = {2/3, -1/3}) from division algebra structure would strengthen R-ratio from [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] to [FRAMEWORK-DERIVED].
2. **Phase 3 ready**: Bound states (hadron masses, nuclear binding) are next. Hadron mass formulas may have more framework content than scattering.
3. **alpha_s derivation**: alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1180 is [A-IMPORT]. If the framework could predict alpha_s from division algebra structure (not just b_0), the QCD corrections would become fully derived.
4. **R at 10 GeV**: Pull = -1.10 sigma (prediction 3.52 vs measured 3.58). Higher-order QCD corrections and charm threshold effects likely explain this. Not a framework issue.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 2 scattering processes complete. The `scattering/` subdirectory now has 2 files with 9 process entries covering EM and strong scattering. The R-ratio is the framework's strongest hadronic test: N_c = Im_H = 3 enters directly as a derived color factor, and b_0 = Im_O = 7 enters QCD corrections. Combined with Phase 1 (decays), the sub-catalog system now has 4 files, 18 process entries, and 3 dedicated verification scripts (47/47 PASS). Catalog v3.2 (54 scripts, 663 tests).

**Recommended next**: Phase 3 (bound states -- hadron masses, nuclear binding, quarkonia) or return to physics investigations (EQ-003 coset geometry, EQ-007 democratic counting mechanism).
