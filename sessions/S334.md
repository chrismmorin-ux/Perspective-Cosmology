# Session S334: Launch C1a — Math Foundations Chunk 2 (Part II)

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Math Foundations publication, Chunk 2: Part II Geometric Consequences (Sections 5-8)
**Topic**: `publications/PC_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S333 (Chunk 1: Part I, Sections 1-4)

---

## Outcome

Part II (Sections 5-8) written and integrated into PC_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md. Document now at v0.5 (734 lines, Parts I-II complete). Four sections covering the geometric consequences of the forced dimensions: Grassmannian topology, crystallization dynamics, evaluation map, and Lorentz signature derivation. Zero TODOs. All key S291 corrections (H_2=Z/2, chi=20, quat-Kahler) incorporated.

## Key Findings

1. **Section 5 (Grassmannian)**: Gr+(4,11;R) = SO(11)/(SO(4)xSO(7)), dim=28, chi=20=n_d(n_c-1)/2. Betti polynomial with b_4=2. Quat-Kahler 4-form Omega_4 globally defined. 7 quaternionic pairs = Im_O. S291 corrections fully integrated (H_2=Z/2 not Z, no symplectic 2-form for k>=3).

2. **Section 6 (Crystallization)**: Tilt epsilon in Hom(R^4,R^7) as rectangular 4x7 matrix. CONJ-B1 [THEOREM via FFT]: Z_2 symmetry forces quartic potential F=-a|eps|^2+b|eps|^4. CONJ-B3 [THEOREM]: gradient flow convergence via Lojasiewicz. Goldstone manifold = Gr+ itself, N_G = 55-6-21 = 28.

3. **Section 7 (Evaluation Map)**: THM_04AC: evaluation-induced perspective (n^2 > n forces blind spots). Rank selection k=4 from Frobenius + CCP. Observable algebra End_C(C^2) = M_2(C). Composition blindness theorem.

4. **Section 8 (Lorentz Signature)**: Herm(2) = R^4 with two SU(2)-invariant quadratic forms: Tr(X^2) Euclidean (4,0), det(X) Lorentzian (1,3). Jordan algebra family: F=C selects h_2(C) = R^{1,3}. Irreducibility theorem: su(2) irreducible under SU(2) forces S = Herm(2). Full chain CCP -> F=C -> M_2(C) -> Herm(2) -> (1,3) -> SO+(1,3).

## Open Questions

1. **Chunk 3 (Secs 9-12)**: End(V) decomposition 121=16+28+28+49, pipeline, gauge groups, generations. Key sources: `perspective_transformative_pipeline.md`, S321, S328.
2. **Goldstone manifold stabilizer**: Section 6.6 uses generic/democratic stabilizer. The exact stabilizer for the democratic configuration could be computed more explicitly.
3. **Spectral metric selection**: Section 8.5 presents 5 arguments for det over Tr. This is [DERIVATION], not [THEOREM] — the selection is well-motivated but not uniquely forced by a single clean argument.

## Key Context for Next Session

Part II is complete. The document now flows: axioms (Sec 1) -> division algebras (Sec 2) -> forced dimensions (Sec 3) -> number theory (Sec 4) -> Grassmannian (Sec 5) -> crystallization (Sec 6) -> evaluation map (Sec 7) -> Lorentz signature (Sec 8). Next is Part III (Chunk 3): the algebraic structure that connects the geometric foundations to gauge groups and particle content. Key transition: Section 7 establishes the observable algebra M_2(C) and the End(V) evaluation structure; Section 9 will decompose End(V) = 121 into the four Hom blocks and begin the pipeline 121 -> 55 -> 18 -> 12.
