# Session S290: Top Yukawa from SO(11) Full Compositeness (EQ-006)

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: EQ-006 — derive top Yukawa y_t from SO(11) partial compositeness
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S212 (fermion embedding resolved: spinorial/MCHM4), S214 (EQ-006 blocked assessment)

## Outcome

Derived **y_t = 1 at tree level** [CONJECTURE] from full compositeness in the SO(11) framework. The key insight: framework fermions ARE algebraic (division algebra structure), so there is no separate "elementary" sector. This forces full compositeness (sin(theta) = 1), and the NDA mass relation makes Y_* cancel exactly, giving y_t = 1 independent of any coupling constant or CG coefficient. The tree-level prediction m_t = v/sqrt(2) = 174.10 GeV deviates 0.82% from measured 172.69 GeV, firmly in Band A (QCD corrections). This partially resolves EQ-006 and closes the m_H prediction chain: y_t=1 -> lambda_H=125/968 -> m_H=125.13 GeV (0.72 sigma).

## Key Findings

1. **y_t = 1 from full compositeness** [CONJECTURE]: In partial compositeness, y_t = Y_* * sin(theta_L) * sin(theta_R) * f / M_1. Framework fermions have no elementary sector -> sin(theta) = 1. NDA gives M_1 = Y_* * f. Therefore y_t = Y_*f/(Y_*f) = 1, independent of Y_*. Two [A-STRUCTURAL] assumptions: NDA mass relation and 3rd generation maximal alignment.

2. **CG coefficient cancels** [DERIVATION]: The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for spinor x spinor -> coset appears in both Y_eff and M_1, so it cancels. y_t = 1 is topological (from existence of coupling, not its strength). Verified: SO(11) spinor 32 x 32 contains adjoint 55 via Lambda^2, and coset 28 is a subspace. Clifford algebra gives uniform trace norm for all generators.

3. **m_t(tree) = v/sqrt(2) = 174.10 GeV** [CONJECTURE]: Deviation from measured 172.69 +/- 0.30 GeV is 0.82% = 8187 ppm (4.7 sigma). Band A of tree-to-dressed paradigm. Correction dominated by standard QCD effects.

4. **m_H chain closes** [CONJECTURE chain]: y_t=1 -> CW with pi^2 cancellation (S180) -> lambda_0 = N_c/24 = 1/O -> vacuum misalignment correction (1+xi) -> lambda_H = 125/968 -> m_H = 125.13 GeV (0.72 sigma from measured 125.25). Chain has 3 structural assumptions.

5. **Post-hoc coefficient observation** [SPECULATION]: The QCD correction coefficient C = -4/17 = -n_d/(n_d^2+1) matches to 0.003% residual. Flagged as POST-HOC — coincidence until mechanism derived.

6. **Uniqueness**: No simple framework fraction a/b within 1% of y_t(pole). No sqrt(a/b) within 0.5%. y_t = 1 is the simplest tree-level value.

7. **Key weakness: y_b/y_t hierarchy**: Full compositeness argument gives y = 1 for ALL 3rd-gen fermions, but y_b/y_t ~ 0.024. SU(2) structure within the generation must provide suppression. This is UNSOLVED.

## Derivation Chain

```
[A-AXIOM] Division algebra fermions (15 = 1+2+4+8 per gen)
  -> [D] SO(11) spinor embedding (S212: 32 contains 15+nu_R=16)
  -> [D] No elementary sector -> full compositeness (sin(theta)=1)
  -> [A-STRUCTURAL] NDA mass relation M_1 = Y_* * f
  -> [D] y_t = Y_* * f / (Y_* * f) = 1 (CG cancels)
  -> [A-STRUCTURAL] 3rd gen maximally aligned in Im(H)
  -> [D] m_t(tree) = v/sqrt(2) = 174.10 GeV
  -> [I-MATH] QCD corrections (Band A, ~0.8%)
  -> [D] m_t(dressed) ~ 172.7 GeV
```

## Open Questions

1. **y_b/y_t suppression** (NEW): Full compositeness gives y=1 for all 3rd-gen fermions, but y_b ~ 0.024. What SU(2) mechanism distinguishes top from bottom within the same generation? Critical for extending beyond y_t.

2. **QCD coefficient derivation** (NEW, LOW): The coefficient C = -4/17 in m_t(dressed) = v/sqrt(2) * (1 - 4*alpha_s/(17*pi)) matches to 0.003%. Is this a standard SM QCD result or does it have framework significance?

3. **Vacuum alignment in Im(H)** (EXISTING): The "3rd generation is maximally aligned" claim needs a dynamical derivation from the vacuum alignment in the quaternionic sector. Blocks full Yukawa hierarchy derivation.

4. **NDA mass relation validity** (EXISTING): M_1 = Y_* * f is [A-STRUCTURAL]. Can it be derived from the framework's composite sector dynamics? If M_1 ≠ Y_*f, y_t ≠ 1.

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-006 is PARTIALLY RESOLVED: y_t = 1 derived from full compositeness [CONJECTURE] with two [A-STRUCTURAL] assumptions (NDA mass relation, 3rd gen alignment). The CG coefficient cancels — a satisfying structural result. The m_H chain is now closed: y_t=1 -> lambda_H=125/968 -> m_H=125.13 GeV. The main open gap is the y_b/y_t hierarchy within the 3rd generation. The full Yukawa hierarchy (all 9 fermion masses) requires understanding vacuum alignment in Im(H).
