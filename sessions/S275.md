# Session 275: Non-Observations from Framework Topology and Algebra

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Magnetic monopole absence + systematic non-observation survey
**Topic**: gauge/topology/meta
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S271 (Yang-Mills), S258 (CONJ-A3)

---

## Outcome

Starting from the monopole question, expanded to a systematic survey of **12 non-observations** all explained by the framework's structure. Two root causes: SO(11) symmetry (topological defects) and division algebra R+C+H+O (particle content + symmetry properties).

**Highlight**: The complete homotopy table of the breaking chain shows the framework is **topologically sterile** — every non-trivial homotopy group is Z/2Z (pair-annihilating), never Z (stable). No cosmological relic defects of any kind.

**Strongest new prediction**: Proton is **absolutely stable** (F-STR-7) — quarks (O-channel) and leptons (C-channel) live in different division algebra sectors with no cross-channel gauge bosons. Hyper-K (~2030) is a key discriminating test vs GUTs.

## Key Findings

1. **pi_2(Gr_+(4,11)) = Z/2Z** [THEOREM]: No stable monopoles. SO vs SU root cause. (magnetic_monopole_absence.py, 26/26 PASS)

2. **Complete topological defect table** [THEOREM]: All 4 defect types (walls, strings, monopoles, textures) across all 3 breaking stages — every non-trivial entry is Z/2Z. No Z entries anywhere.

3. **12 non-observations from 2 root causes** [DERIVATION]:
   - A1-A4: Topological defects (monopoles, strings, walls, textures) — from SO(11) homotopy
   - B1-B4: Particle content (3 gen, 3+1D, confinement, no SUSY) — from division algebras
   - C1-C4: Symmetry (proton stability, strong CP, chirality, hierarchy) — from R+C+O structure

4. **Proton absolute stability** [DERIVATION]: Channel separation (R+C+O) prevents baryon number violation. No leptoquark gauge bosons exist. Falsifiable at Hyper-K.

5. **C-channel insight** (user): EM from C-plane + Gaussian norm C -> R topologically trivial -> no monopole winding. Connects to rigorous SO vs SU argument.

## Open Questions

1. **Proton stability depth**: Can we prove the R+C+O channel separation is exact non-perturbatively, or could quantum effects mix channels? (Would strengthen C1 from DERIVATION to THEOREM)
2. **Strong CP proof gap**: CR-029 blocks THM_0497. Can a cleaner argument derive theta_QCD = 0 from G_2 ancestry without the step-4 error?

## Key Context for Next Session

Two CANONICAL investigations written. The framework now has a systematic account of 12 non-observations, all from the same mathematics that derives the SM. The proton stability prediction (F-STR-7) is the sharpest discriminator vs GUTs — Hyper-K (~2030) is the key experiment. The complete homotopy table (every non-trivial entry Z/2Z, never Z) is a clean structural result at THEOREM level.
