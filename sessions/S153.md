# Session 153 — Unify Step 5C and 5D for Alpha

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Focus**: Unify Step 5C (induced) and 5D (crystallization) for alpha
**Topic**: `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S149 (Step 5 coefficient correction)
**Next**: S155 (Weinberg running analysis)

---

## Outcome

Unified 5C+5D mechanism. Per-sector induced couplings computed: S_2=29, S_3=8. sin^2(theta_W) = 29/126 (0.45%) vs S151's 28/121 (0.08%). Denominator tension unresolved.

## Key Findings

1. **Per-sector induced couplings**: The 137 tilt modes decompose by gauge charge. S_EM=126, S_2=29, S_3=8.
2. **sin^2(theta_W) = S_2*alpha_EM/alpha_2 = 29/126** — alternative to S151's 28/121. Error: 0.45% vs 0.08%.
3. **Denominator tension**: 121 (=n_c^2) vs 126 (=N_I-n_c). Two structural origins, both legitimate.
4. **Two formulas bracket measured value**: 28/121 = 0.2314, 29/126 = 0.2302, measured = 0.23122.
5. **Algebraic difference**: 28/121 - 29/126 = 19/(n_c^2 * C * Im_H^2 * Im_O), where 19 = n_d^2 + Im_H.

## Open Questions

1. Which denominator is correct — 121 or 126? Or is the truth a combination?
2. Does SM running from a composite scale reconcile the two? → Tested in S155 (FALSIFIED)
3. What physical mechanism gives sin^2 = N_Goldstone/n_c^2 vs S_2/(S_EM+n_c)?
