# Session 211: Top Physics Priorities — Rapid Assessment

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: All 6 top investigation priorities from quality engine, assessed in order
**Topic**: Cross-cutting (eval map, CMB, alpha, CC, cyclotomic)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S209 (structural cleanup), S200 (eval map gauge chain)
**Parallel**: S210 (EWSB predictions), S212 (collider-crystallization)

---

## Outcome

Rapid assessment of all 6 top-priority physics investigations. Two concrete results (Herm(2) gap reduction, Step 5 mechanism elimination), one new verification script for cyclotomic patterns, three priorities assessed as blocked. Honest narrowing of the search space rather than breakthroughs.

## Key Findings

### 1. Herm(2) = Spacetime (Priority #1, Score 14.4) — GAP REDUCED

**Path (A) Connes spectral triple: DEAD END.** A spectral triple on M₂(C) gives a zero-dimensional NCG — a fuzzy sphere approximation of S², not R^{3,1}. Connes distance on state space gives B³ (3D Bloch ball), missing the time dimension. Literature: D'Andrea-Lizzi-Varilly (2012), Lira-Torres-Majid (2022/2024). Connes' SM construction INPUTS the 4-manifold.

**Path (D) Jordan algebra: PRODUCTIVE.** h₂(K) family: K=R→R^{2,1}, K=C→R^{3,1}, K=H→R^{5,1}, K=O→R^{9,1}. Framework's F=C (THM_0485) uniquely selects h₂(C) = R^{3,1}. Same axiom gives Hilbert space, gauge group, AND spacetime dimension.

**Result**: [A-PHYSICAL] gap reduced from specific structural identification to general operationalism ("physical events are distinguished by measurement outcomes"). Gap is now philosophical, not mathematical. Boyle-Farnsworth (2019) Jordan geometry program noted as active literature connection.

**Confidence**: [DERIVATION] for Jordan algebra selection, [A-PHYSICAL] for operational identification.

### 2. Ω_m = 63/200 Mechanism (Priority #2, Score 13.3) — DEFERRED

No mechanism exists. Triple-formula problem (13/19, 137/200, α⁵⁶/77) is a RED FLAG. All formulas post-hoc. Crystallization route blocked by F-10 (wrong-sign CC). Goldstone thermalization has no clear path from 43 modes to 63/200. **DEFERRED until F-10 is resolved.**

### 3. Alpha Step 5: Democratic Counting (Priority #3, Score 10.7) — MECHANISM ELIMINATED

**Critical equipartition RULED OUT.** The SO(11) crystallization transition is first-order (no Wilson-Fisher fixed point for N≥4, discriminant < 0 per `so11_beta_functions.py`). A first-order transition does NOT equalize mode contributions.

Updated mechanism status:
- Mechanism 1 (mass decoupling): RULED OUT (prior)
- Mechanism 2 (critical equipartition): **RULED OUT** (S211)
- Mechanism 3 (coset geometry): **ONLY REMAINING PATH**

The coset volume fraction sin²θ_W = 28/121 = dim(coset)/dim(End(V)) converges with the eval map decomposition Hom(W,W^⊥)/End(V). Both give 28/121 by independent routes. But WHY the coupling constant equals a geometric fraction remains open.

### 4. CC Wrong Sign F-10 (Priority #4, Score 9.3) — BLOCKED

V(ε*) = −α⁶M_Pl²/2 < 0 but Λ > 0. No clear path to resolution without fundamentally new idea about the crystallization potential. Left as F-10.

### 5. CMB V₀ Amplitude (Priority #5, Score 8.0) — BLOCKED

Blocked on mass scale f derivation (Priority #10). No progress without it.

### 6. Cyclotomic 43 Pattern (Priority #6, Score 8.0) — PATTERN VERIFIED, UNIQUENESS FAILS

Unified pattern discovered: three Tier 1 formulas share the structure A + B/Φ₆(k):
- 1/α = 137 + 4/Φ₆(11), correction from u(n_c) EM channels
- v/m_p = 262 + 18/Φ₆(7), correction from u(Im_O) EM channels
- m_μ/m_e = 207 − 10/Φ₆(7), same hidden sector scale

New: 23 = n_c + H + O in the m_μ/m_e numerator (207 = Im_H² × 23).

Φ₆ is prime at division algebra dims {C, Im_H, H, Im_O} = {3, 7, 13, 43}, NOT prime at composite dims {O, n_c} = {57, 111}.

**But uniqueness FAILS**: other degree-2 polynomials can produce small remainders for both mass ratios. The Φ₆ selection is not unique, weakening the structural necessity argument.

**Confidence**: [CONJECTURE]. Pattern is genuine but post-hoc and not unique.

- `verification/sympy/cyclotomic_43_pattern.py` — Unified Φ₆ pattern, EM channel counting, numerator decompositions, uniqueness test

## Files Modified
- `framework/investigations/meta/evaluation_map_foundations.md` — Herm(2) gap section rewritten, Jordan algebra analysis, verification table updated, session history added
- `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md` — Critical equipartition ruled out, coset geometry flagged as only remaining path
- `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` — Session registration

## Open Questions

1. **Coset geometry derivation**: Can the coset volume fraction sin²θ_W = 28/121 be promoted from [CONJECTURE] to [DERIVATION]? Needs: proof that gauge coupling = geometric fraction of configuration space.
2. **Operational identification formalization**: Can "events = measurement outcomes" be stated as a precise axiom, reducing the Herm(2) gap to a single clean [A-PHYSICAL]?
3. **F-10 resolution**: Is there a mechanism for V > 0 in the crystallization potential?
4. **Cyclotomic mechanism**: WHY do mass ratios involve EM channel counts (Φ₆)?

## Key Context for Next Session

This session performed a rapid triage of all 6 top physics priorities. Results:
- **Concrete progress**: Herm(2) gap reduced (Jordan algebra + operational), Step 5 mechanism 2 eliminated (first-order transition)
- **Blocked**: Priorities 2, 4, 5 all blocked on F-10 or mass scale f
- **Pattern documented**: Cyclotomic Φ₆ two-scale structure (crystal u(11) vs hidden u(7))

The most actionable next step for physics is the **coset geometry derivation** (only remaining Step 5 path), or investigating the **Boyle-Farnsworth Jordan geometry** program for Herm(2).
