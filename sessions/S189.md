# Session 189 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: Phase 4C: Mixing angles audit (CKM, Weinberg, theta_QCD)
**Topic**: Particle physics audit (`topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S188 (Phase 4B: Mass formulas)
**Next**: Phase 4D (Collider phenomenology) or Phase 5 (Cosmology)

---

## Outcome

Phase 4C DONE. All three mixing angle domains audited with assumption classifications. CKM/PMNS: 11 formulas all [CONJECTURE] (searched, not derived), but collective probability ~10⁻¹² significant. Weinberg: three-scheme classification (tree [DERIVATION], 28/121 [DERIVATION with gap], 171/194 [CONJECTURE]). theta_QCD: DOWNGRADED SKETCH→CONJECTURE (Steps 5-7 address directional symmetry, but theta is topological via instantons — wrong mechanism).

---

## Key Findings

1. **CKM/PMNS all [CONJECTURE]** [S189-AUDIT]: All 11 mixing angle formulas were discovered by numerical search over division algebra ratios. Individual matches not significant. Collective match (trials-corrected ~10⁻¹²) is significant. Red flags: "5" in λ=9/40 and "10" in sin²θ₁₂=10/33 have no framework origin.

2. **Weinberg three-scheme classification** [S189-AUDIT]:
   - Tree sin²θ_W = 1/4: genuine [DERIVATION] from SO(11) rank-based argument (grade A)
   - MS-bar sin²θ_W = 28/121: [DERIVATION with gap] — 28=N_Goldstone is structural, but Step 5 gap (WHY sin²=28/121?) (grade B-)
   - On-shell cos(θ_W) = 171/194: [CONJECTURE] — 3.75 ppm but numerically discovered (grade C+)

3. **theta_QCD DOWNGRADED** [S189-AUDIT]: THM_0497 downgraded SKETCH→CONJECTURE. CR-029 deleted Step 4 (π₃(G₂)=Z, not 0). Steps 5-7 argue about directional symmetry on S⁶ (G₂ transitivity), but theta arises from instantons (topological winding via π₃(SU(3))=Z). Different mechanisms — the proof is invalid. Prediction (theta=0) is still specific, falsifiable, and kept as CONJECTURE. Grade D.

4. **PDG 2024 corrections**: derivations_summary.md section 1.11 had stale values. Updated δ_CKM from "0.07%" to "3.9%" (PDG 2024 shifted central value).

## Open Questions

1. **Step 5 gap**: WHY does sin²θ_W = N_Goldstone/n_c²? The 28 is structural (from SO(11) breaking), but the ratio to 121 lacks dynamics. This is the single most important open question in the Weinberg angle derivation.

2. **CKM denominators**: Can "5" in λ=9/40 and "10" in sin²θ₁₂=10/33 be derived from framework structure? Currently unexplained.

3. **theta_QCD promotion path**: Need one of: (a) topological argument from SU(3)→G₂ embedding constraining theta vacuum, (b) dynamical crystallization argument, or (c) discrete octonion multiplication table argument.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 4A (alpha chain), 4B (mass formulas), and 4C (mixing angles) are all DONE. Remaining in Phase 4: **4D (Collider Phenomenology)** — EWSB mechanism (S175), beta function separation (CR-048), CW potential (S179-180). Alternatively, Phase 5 (Cosmology) or Phase 6 (Gravity) can run in parallel per the master plan.

Pattern across Phase 4: correction terms (sub-leading contributions) are more defensible than main terms. The derivation-vs-discovery problem is most acute for mixing angles (all searched) and mass formulas (main terms post-hoc). The alpha chain is the strongest (13/17 steps derived).
