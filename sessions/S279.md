# Session S279

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Weinberg angle: structural origin of 1/(4*pi) coefficient + Band B
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S276 (Weinberg one-loop coefficient)
**Next**: Band B structural mechanism; predict new quantity from paradigm

---

## Outcome

Resolved the structural origin of the Weinberg one-loop coefficient: **n_d = dim(H) = 4** in the standard alpha/(16*pi^2) basis. The mixing angle sin^2 parameterizes the R^4 = H orientation in the Hom(R^4,R^7) coset; the correction scans all n_d directions equally (SO(4) isotropy). This resolves the S276 negative result: mixing angles have geometric coefficients (from embedding space dimension), while coupling strengths have algebraic coefficients (from charge traces). Also discovered Band B coefficients: m_mu/m_e ~ 1/n_d (4%) and v/m_p ~ 1/n_c (0.1%), but cos(theta_W) is unreliable due to m_W experimental uncertainty.

## Key Findings

1. **Coefficient = n_d = dim(H) in standard loop basis** [CONJECTURE]: delta(sin^2) = n_d * alpha/(16*pi^2) = 4 * alpha/(16*pi^2). Three equivalent decompositions of 4*pi^2: (a) n_d*pi^2, (b) dim(C)*Vol(S^3), (c) (16*pi^2)/n_d. Unique within 1 sigma (n=3,5 at ~1.7 sigma). 0.00 sigma from measured.

2. **Structural argument from Hom(R^4,R^7)** [CONJECTURE]: 28 coset modes = R^4 x R^7. sin^2 parameterizes the R^4 (defect) orientation, NOT the R^7 (spectator). One-loop correction scans n_d = dim(R^4) = dim(H) directions, each contributing alpha/(16*pi^2). Alternatives Im_O=7 (4.6 sigma) and n_d*Im_O=28 (37 sigma) ruled out.

3. **Mixing vs coupling distinction** [CONJECTURE]: Resolves S276 T_3 negative result. Mixing angles (orientations) have geometric coefficients from dim of embedding space; coupling strengths (magnitudes) have algebraic coefficients from charge traces. T_3 traces give 6/11 for Weinberg (WRONG, because it's algebraic), while Q_EM traces give 24/11 for alpha (CORRECT, because alpha IS algebraic).

4. **Band B: m_mu/m_e coefficient** [SPECULATION, HRS 5]: C_B = 0.240, matches 1/n_d = 1/4 to 4.0%. Dressed m_mu/m_e = 206.76832, measured = 206.76828, residual = 0.17 ppm = 8 sigma (limited by measurement precision).

5. **Band B: v/m_p coefficient** [SPECULATION, HRS 5]: C_B = 0.091, matches 1/n_c = 1/11 to 0.1%. Dressed v/m_p = 262.4182, matches measured exactly (0.00 ppm residual).

6. **cos(theta_W) unreliable** [FINDING]: Gap ranges from 4 ppm (m_W = 80.377, PDG 2022) to 93 ppm (m_W = 80.3692, PDG 2024 avg). CDF II controversy makes this quantity unsuitable for coefficient extraction.

7. **Cross-band pattern** [SPECULATION]: C_A * C_B1 = n_d * (1/n_d) = 1 exactly (unitarity-like). The n_d structure in Band A is inverted in Band B.

## Open Questions

1. **Band B structural mechanism** (EQ-039 extension): Why C_B = 1/n_d for m_mu/m_e? Is this the inverse of the Band A coefficient, reflecting a two-loop/one-loop relationship? Why 1/n_c for v/m_p specifically?

2. **Predict a NEW quantity**: The paradigm now has coefficients for Bands A, B, and C. Can it predict a quantity not yet measured, or a precision improvement on a measured quantity?

3. **m_W experimental resolution**: The cos(theta_W) Band B classification depends on which m_W value is used. CDF resolution (expected 2026-2027) would settle this.

4. **Three-loop C_3 prediction**: Residual from Band C is 0.8x alpha^3/pi^2. The tree->dressed paradigm predicts a specific coefficient -- can it be derived?

## Key Context for Next Session

The tree-to-dressed paradigm now has explicit coefficients for all three bands:

| Band | Quantity | Coefficient | Basis | Confidence |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|------------|
| A | sin^2(theta_W) | n_d = 4 | alpha/(16*pi^2) | [CONJECTURE] |
| B | m_mu/m_e | ~1/n_d = 1/4 | alpha^2/pi | [SPECULATION] |
| B | v/m_p | ~1/n_c = 1/11 | alpha^2/pi | [SPECULATION] |
| C | 1/alpha | 24/11 | alpha^2/pi | [CONJECTURE] |

The mixing vs coupling distinction explains why different correction types have different coefficient structures (geometric vs algebraic). The cross-band relation C_A * C_B1 = 1 is suggestive but unexplained.

The Band B coefficients (1/n_d, 1/n_c) are at [SPECULATION] level with HRS 5 -- they match known values and the structural arguments are thin. They need either independent derivation or novel prediction to be upgraded.
