# Session 172 -- 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Gap G2 -- Derive Mexican hat coefficients a, b from axioms
**Topic**: `topics/casimir-crystallization.md` (G2 from S169)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S171 (G7 resolved), S169 (generalized crystallization pressure)

---

## Outcome

Derived the Mexican hat quartic coefficient b = alpha M_Pl^4 from the framework's democratic distribution principle (THM_0496). The SAME democratic mechanism that gives alpha = 1/N_I also gives b = M_Pl^4/N_I when applied to the quartic self-coupling. Combined with eps*_MH = alpha (THM_04A2), this fully determines a = 2 alpha^3 M_Pl^4.

This provides a MECHANISM for values that S132/S133 established by self-consistency. Gap G2 is partially closed: a and b are derived given one structural assumption (B_total = M_Pl^4).

**Confidence**: [CONJECTURE] -- democratic quartic extension not formally proven

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Democratic Quartic Derivation [CONJECTURE]

THM_0496 establishes that N_I = 137 interface modes share couplings democratically via the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. Applying this to the quartic self-coupling:

```
B_total = M_Pl^4    (natural quartic scale) [A-STRUCTURAL]
b = B_total / N_I = M_Pl^4 / 137 = alpha M_Pl^4  [CONJECTURE]
```

This is the SAME ratio as the gauge coupling: alpha = 1/N_I.

### Finding 2: Full Coefficient Determination [DERIVATION]

Combined with THM_04A2 (eps*_MH = alpha):

```
a = 2b * (eps*)^2 = 2 * alpha * alpha^2 * M_Pl^4 = 2 alpha^3 M_Pl^4
a/b = 2 alpha^2 = 2/18769
```

All downstream quantities follow:
- m_tilt = 2*sqrt(2) * alpha^(3/2) * M_Pl ~ 2.15e16 GeV (GUT scale)
- W(eps*) = -alpha^5 M_Pl^4 (potential depth)
- m_tilt/H >> 1 (inflationary stability)

### Finding 3: Structural Parallel [DERIVATION]

The democratic principle yields the same ratio for both sectors:

```
alpha = 1/N_I       (gauge coupling, dimensionless)
b/M_Pl^4 = 1/N_I   (quartic coupling, mass dim 4)
```

Both: X = X_total / N_I. The alpha suppression of b relative to M_Pl^4 is EXPLAINED by mode sharing, not assumed.

### Finding 4: Comparison to Prior Approaches [DERIVATION]

Six prior approaches in S132 attempted to derive b:
- S132 approach 2 found the SAME VALUES (b = alpha M_Pl^4) but without a mechanism
- S133 found b = alpha M_Pl^4 from inflationary self-consistency (independent confirmation)
- S138c showed CW (Coleman-Weinberg) CANNOT pin b (radiative corrections too small)
- Democratic quartic provides the MISSING mechanism

### Finding 5: Sensitivity Analysis [DERIVATION]

If B_total = c * M_Pl^4 instead of M_Pl^4:
- c = 1/10: m_tilt ~ 6.8e15 GeV (still stable, m/H >> 1)
- c = 1: m_tilt ~ 2.15e16 GeV (GUT scale, excellent)
- c = 137: m_tilt ~ 2.5e17 GeV (approaching Planck, unnatural)

The democratic argument uniquely selects c = 1.

## Derivation Chain

```
[A-AXIOM] AXM_0109 + AXM_0110 --> division algebra structure
[D]       N_I = H^2 + n_c^2 = 137 (interface modes)
[D]       THM_0496: democratic coupling via HS inner product
[D]       alpha = 1/N_I (gauge coupling)
[A-STRUCTURAL] B_total = M_Pl^4 (natural quartic scale)
[CONJECTURE]   b = B_total/N_I = alpha M_Pl^4 (democratic quartic)
[D from THM_04A2] eps*_MH = alpha (single-photon tilt)
[D]       a = 2b*(eps*)^2 = 2 alpha^3 M_Pl^4
[D]       m_tilt = 2*sqrt(2) * alpha^(3/2) * M_Pl
```

## Gap G2 Status

**PARTIALLY CLOSED**. The coefficients a, b are now derived from:
1. Democratic distribution (THM_0496) applied to quartic sector
2. Single-photon tilt equilibrium (THM_04A2)
3. One structural assumption: B_total = M_Pl^4

Remaining: Derive B_total = M_Pl^4 from axioms (or accept as [A-STRUCTURAL]).

---

## Open Questions

1. **Can B_total = M_Pl^4 be derived?** It's "natural" for the total quartic energy to be at the Planck scale, but this is an assumption. Could it follow from the AXM_0109 crystal existence axiom?

2. **Why does the democratic principle extend to quartic couplings?** THM_0496 is proven for gauge couplings via Schur's lemma and HS inner product. Does the same argument apply to quartic self-couplings of the tilt field?

3. **CW connection**: Coleman-Weinberg radiative corrections are too small to pin b (S138c). Is the democratic quartic complementary (tree-level) while CW is a loop correction?

4. **Two counting schemes**: The 16-DOF tilt matrix vs 137-mode interface decomposition -- which applies to quartic coupling? (The script uses N_I = 137, matching the gauge sector.)

## Key Context for Next Session

S172 derived Mexican hat coefficients a, b from the democratic distribution principle: b = M_Pl^4/N_I (same mechanism as alpha = 1/N_I). This PARTIALLY CLOSES Gap G2 from S169 -- one structural assumption (B_total = M_Pl^4) remains. The value matches S132/S133's self-consistent result, now with a mechanism.

The 8 remaining gaps from S169 are now: G1 (nucleation trigger), G2 (partially closed -- B_total assumption), G3 (types as SSB stages), G4 (confinement = O-Casimir), G5 (particle masses), G6 (c_3 > 0), G8 (240 numerology), G9 (strong coupling).

Next: Return to other high-impact topics (CW calculation for b2 sign, or CMB Phase 5.3/6, or new physics), or attempt to derive B_total = M_Pl^4 from axioms.
