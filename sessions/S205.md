# Session 205: System-Wide Claims Audit and Strengthening

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Full audit across all tiers — verify scripts, fix cross-file consistency, resolve open decisions
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S204 (claims precision audit)

---

## Outcome

Systematic audit of all claims files found 15 issues across 6 categories: script bugs, stale counts, precision mismatches, numbering errors, reference inconsistencies, and unresolved tier decisions. All 15 fixed. One demotion (r_s), one promotion (m_mu/m_e). Tier 1 count unchanged at 12 but caveats reduced from 4 to 3.

## Key Findings

### 1. r_s = 337x3/7 DEMOTED from Tier 1 to Tier 2

Both factors independently falsified: eta* = 337 (F-8, actual 280 Mpc) and c_s = 3/7 (F-9, 5.6-20% error). The 9.9 ppm product match is compensating errors (HRS=7). Framework parameters DO produce r_s = 144.48 via standard physics (0.03%), but this is derivative of H0/Om_m/Om_b — not independent. Sound_horizon_337_origin.py was found to pass tests on a falsified claim (outdated script).

### 2. m_mu/m_e = 8891/43 PROMOTED to Tier 1

4.1 ppm is clearly sub-10 ppm. Uses Phi_6(Im_O) = 43, same cyclotomic denominator as v/m_p (Tier 1 #7, 1.63 ppm). Two Tier 1 claims sharing the same denominator is a structural signal worth investigating. Formula: 207 - 10/43.

### 3. Script Bug Fixed: tier1_baryon_meson_audit.py

CRITICAL FINDINGS section said "CONFIRMED sub-10 ppm" for m_B0/Sigma-, contradicting the script's own data showing 11.08 ppm. Text corrected to reflect demotion.

### 4. Stale Count Fixed: TIER_3 "Only 3"

TIER_3_MATCHED.md line 545 said "Only 3 are statistically significant (Tier 1)" — should have been 12. Critical error in honest assessment section.

### 5. Precision Values Corrected

- sin^2(theta_W) MS-bar: 74 ppm -> 30 ppm (Tier 2 table)
- m_tau/m_mu: 70 ppm -> 68.5 ppm (matching script output)
- Quark Koide: header said "8 Constants" but only 6 parameters listed

### 6. CODATA Reference Harmonized

UNDENIABLE_CORE.md referenced "CODATA 2022" while all scripts and Tier 1 use CODATA 2018. Corrected to CODATA 2018.

| 15 | Tier 3 ~45 vs ~41 inconsistency | Count | Harmonized to ~41 |

## Open Questions

1. **sound_horizon_337_origin.py**: Should this script be rewritten to test the standard-physics r_s calculation instead of the falsified 337x3/7 decomposition?
2. **Cyclotomic 43 pattern**: Two Tier 1 claims (v/m_p and m_mu/m_e) share Phi_6(7) = 43 denominator. Is there a deeper connection to investigate?
3. **sin^2(theta_W) MS precision**: Script says 30 ppm, but the Tier 2 table previously said 74 ppm. Should this be re-verified with a fresh run of weinberg_best_formula.py?

## Key Context for Next Session

The claims system is now internally consistent across all 8 files. Tier 1 has 12 claims with 3 caveats (Omega_Lambda triple formula, cos theta_W m_W-sensitive, Xi0/m_d quark uncertainty). The honest robust count is ~9. The r_s demotion removes the most compromised claim (compensating errors from two falsified factors). The m_mu/m_e promotion adds a clean cyclotomic-denominator claim that pairs structurally with v/m_p.
