# Session S343: Launch C1a — Math Foundations Chunk 6 (Appendices + Final Review)

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Write Appendices A-D and final consistency review of PC_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md
**Topic**: `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` Section 3.1a (Chunk 6 of 6 — FINAL)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S342 (Chunk 5: Part V)
**Next**: C1b (Interpretive Companion v1.0)

---

## Outcome

**Document v1.0 COMPLETE.** All 6 chunks done. Final document: 2133 lines, 20 sections in 5 Parts, 4 Appendices, 46 verification scripts referenced (~700 tests). Two cross-reference bugs found and fixed during consistency review. Zero TODOs. Zero physical interpretation leaks.

## Key Findings

1. **Appendix A: Radon-Hurwitz and CONJ-A3 Proof** [THEOREM]
   - Radon-Hurwitz function rho(7) = 1 < 4 = n_d
   - Three independent proofs: parity obstruction (det(-I_7)=-1), Radon-Hurwitz ([4,7,7]-composition impossible), norm extension (11 not in {1,2,4,8})
   - Consequence: I_0 = n_d^2 + n_c^2 (additive, not cross-term) is forced
   - Root cause: n_c - n_d = 7 is odd

2. **Appendix B: FFT and CONJ-B1 Proof** [THEOREM]
   - Tilt epsilon in Hom(R^4, R^7) — rectangular matrix, NOT Sym_0(R^11)
   - FFT: invariant ring generated by Tr((eps^T eps)^j), all even degree in epsilon
   - Z_2 symmetry P(eps) = P(-eps) forced by rectangular structure
   - No cubic term possible — quartic truncation is exact through degree 4

3. **Appendix C: Spectral Convergence and CONJ-A1** [DERIVATION]
   - Negative: quartic potential has dim-2 condensate, WSR diverge
   - Positive: C5 (finiteness) + THM_0491 -> finite Hilbert space -> discrete spectrum -> WSR converge trivially
   - Eliminates IRA-02 as independent assumption
   - Chain: C5 -> finite Hilbert -> WSR -> Schur -> democratic coupling -> 28/121

4. **Appendix D: Verification Script Index**
   - 46 scripts organized by Part (D.1-D.5) and Appendix proofs (D.6)
   - Approximately 700 individual tests
   - All scripts confirmed to exist in verification/sympy/

5. **Consistency Review Results**
   - Cross-reference fix: "Theorem 4.1" -> "Theorem 4.5" (Corollary 14.3 referencing 137 primality)
   - Cross-reference fix: "Definition 4.3" -> "Definition 4.6" (Section 14 referencing cyclotomic polynomial)
   - Theorem numbering: sequential within sections, no errors
   - Confidence tags: present on all theorem statements
   - Notation: n_c, n_d, Im(D), Phi_m consistent throughout
   - Physical interpretation: no leaks (3 acceptable cross-references in Open Problems)

## Scripts

No new scripts written (publication/review session). All appendix content references existing scripts:

| Script | Appendix | Tests | Status |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| `conj_a3_algebraic_incompatibility.py` | A | 27/27 | PASS |
| `conj_b1_z2_rectangular_matrix.py` | B | 10/10 | PASS |
| `spectral_convergence_conj_a1.py` | C | 24/24 | PASS |

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `publications/PC_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md` | v0.95->v1.0. Appendices A-D added (~210 lines). Cross-ref fixes (Thm 4.1->4.5, Def 4.3->4.6). Header updated. Revision history entry. |
| `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` | Chunk 6: COMPLETE. C1a status: COMPLETE. Session history entry. |
| `sessions/INDEX.md` | Added S343. Updated session counter. |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | S343 registered then deregistered. |

## Open Questions

1. **C1b (Interpretive Companion)**: Now the highest-priority content item. Must mirror all 20 sections + appendices section-by-section with physical interpretation.
2. **Appendix D completeness**: 46 of ~713 scripts referenced. The index covers only scripts cited in the document. A full verification portal is planned for the website (Phase 2).
3. **LaTeX rendering**: The document uses $...$ notation throughout. Will need conversion for web rendering (MathJax/KaTeX).

## Key Context for Next Session

PC_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md is now **v1.0 COMPLETE** at 2133 lines. The document covers:
- Part I (Secs 1-4): Algebraic foundations — axioms, CCP, division algebras, forced dimensions
- Part II (Secs 5-8): Geometric consequences — Grassmannian, crystallization, evaluation maps, Lorentz
- Part III (Secs 9-12): Algebraic structure — End(V), pipeline, gauge groups, generations
- Part IV (Secs 13-16): Numerical consequences — alpha (137+4/111), Weinberg (28/121), Omega_m (63/200)
- Part V (Secs 17-20): Extended results — glueballs, QM, Einstein equations, correction bands
- Appendices A-D: Radon-Hurwitz proof, FFT proof, spectral convergence, script index

The next launch plan item is C1b (Interpretive Companion v1.0) or C2 (AI Methodology). C1b is more urgent as it's the paired publication.
