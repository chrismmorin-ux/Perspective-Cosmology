# Session 242: Crystallization Catalog Phase 8b — Actioning Meta-Analysis Results

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Execute the 12 inconsistency fixes and top priorities from S241 meta-analysis
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S241 (Phase 8 meta-analysis)

---

## Outcome

All 4 blocks from the S241 action plan executed. 5 tag inconsistencies resolved, 1 speculation disclaimer added, DM mass discrepancy investigated (3 competing formulas found — not a units error), 2 new verification scripts written. Catalog updated to v3.9 (61 scripts, 749 tests). Tag distribution: 3D (3%), 36C (36%), 60R (61%).

## Key Findings

1. **Re-tags applied** [VERIFIED]: Stochastic GW (#82) R→C (r=7/128 blind prediction), Higgs decay (#8) R→C (κ_V=√(117/121) testable), jet production (#24) sub-catalog R→C (color factors are the point). Net: CONSTRAINED 34→36, RELABELED 62→60.

2. **Dual-tagging resolved**: Bhabha (#17) primary R with C note at Z-pole. Moller (#18) primary R with C note for parity violation. Both now have explicit dual-tag annotations in sub-catalog and resolved in TAG_INDEX.

3. **DM mass discrepancy (EQ-013) investigated** [CONJECTURE]: Three competing formulas found, NOT a units error:
   - Formula A: m_p × 49/9 = 5.108 GeV (from dark_matter_mass_derivation.md)
   - Formula B: m_e × n_c²/n_d = 15.5 MeV (from sub-catalogs)
   - Formula C: m_e × (n_c−1)⁴ = 5.110 GeV (from generation_structure.md)

   A and C agree to 0.03% but use different input masses. B differs by factor ~330. Both cosmological sub-catalog files updated with all three formulas. 10/10 PASS.

4. **Bhabha Z-pole script** [DERIVATION]: sin²=28/121 enters via g_V^e=-9/242, g_A^e=-1/2. A_FB(ee)=0.0164 vs LEP 0.0145±0.0025 (0.8σ). g_V/g_A=9/121=(3/11)². 8/8 PASS.

5. **Moller PV script** [DERIVATION]: Q_W^e=1−4×28/121=9/121=(Im_H/n_c)². Tree-level A_PV=−72.5 ppb (E158: −131±17 ppb; difference from RG running + radiative corrections). sin² runs from 0.2314 at M_Z to 0.2397 at E158 (correct direction). MOLLER experiment may distinguish 9/121 from SM. 8/8 PASS.

6. **Magic numbers disclaimer**: Summary table in nuclear_binding.md now has explicit [SPECULATION] tag with "no derivation, likely numerological" note.

## Open Questions

1. **DM mass formula selection** (EQ-013): Which of the 3 formulas is correct? No mechanism derived for any. Need first-principles DM mass derivation or experimental data.
2. **Bhabha/Moller at Z-pole**: Scripts written but Bhabha/Moller remain primary-tag R. If Z-pole-specific scripts grow, consider splitting Z-pole entries as separate catalog items.
3. **MOLLER experiment** (JLab, future): 2.4% Q_W^e measurement may distinguish 9/121=(3/11)² from SM prediction. Monitor.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 8b actioning is COMPLETE. All 12 inconsistencies from S241 meta-analysis have been addressed (5 re-tags, 1 disclaimer, 6 dual-tags resolved). The DM mass discrepancy turned out to be three competing formulas (not a units error) — none derived from first principles, all [CONJECTURE]. Two new scattering scripts confirm sin²=28/121 enters Bhabha and Moller physics correctly. Catalog now at v3.9 (61 scripts, 749 tests, 3D/36C/60R).

**Remaining from S241 priority list**: r formula ambiguity (EQ-032, monitor for CMB-S4), Ω_m mechanism (EQ-002, blocked on crystallization dynamics), CKM derivation (no path), EW baryogenesis PT strength (uncalculated).
