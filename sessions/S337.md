# Session S337: CCWZ Sigma Model Phase 1

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: CCWZ infrastructure for SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) — Lagrangian construction + SM gauge embedding
**Topic**: `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S332 (alpha_accuracy_plan.md creation), S328 (U(1)_Y embedding), S336 (colored pNGB branching)

---

## Outcome

Phase 1 of the alpha accuracy plan (S332) COMPLETE. Built the full CCWZ setup for SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) with explicit SM gauge embedding. Discovered a critical two-convention charge system: defect-only Q_EM (S272, gives sum(Q^2)=14) vs full SM Q_EM (with T_X, gives sum(Q^2)=50/3). This distinction is the key open question for Phase 2.

## Key Findings

1. **SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) symmetric space VERIFIED** [THEOREM]: All 5 commutation relations [H,H]cH, [H,K]cK, [K,K]cH pass numerically. 55 = 6 + 21 + 28.

2. **SM gauge embedding explicit** [DERIVATION]: SU(2)_L(SM) = SU(2)_R(SO4) = {R1,R2,R3}. U(1)_Y = L1 + T_X where T_X = (1/3)(T_{5,8}+T_{6,9}+T_{7,10}) from the Pati-Salam chain (S336). Q_EM = R3 + L1 + T_X.

3. **Two Q_EM conventions discovered** [DERIVATION]:
   - **Defect-only** (S272): Q_EM = R3 + L1. No T_X. Charges {+1, 0, -1} only. sum(Q^2) = 14 = 2 + 12.
   - **Full SM** (S328+S336): Q_EM = R3 + L1 + T_X. Fractional charges. sum(Q^2) = 50/3 = 2 + 44/3.
   - Higgs charges {+1, 0, 0, -1} IDENTICAL in both (T_X=0 on SU(3)-singlet) [THEOREM].
   - The S272 alpha derivation (C_2 = 24/11 = 12 * 2/11) used defect-only charges implicitly.

4. **Gauge boson mass matrix at EWSB** [DERIVATION]: W+/W-/Z get mass from [R_i, T_{0,4}] != 0. Photon (Q_EM) has [Q_EM, Higgs VEV] = 0. Gluons and T_X massless (don't involve indices 0 or 4).

5. **Colored pNGB charge distribution** [DERIVATION]:
   - Defect-only: {+1:6, 0:12, -1:6} -> sum(Q^2) = 12
   - Full SM: {+4/3:3, +2/3:3, +1/3:6, -1/3:6, -2/3:3, -4/3:3} -> sum(Q^2) = 44/3

6. **OPEN QUESTION for Phase 2**: Which Q_EM enters the CW loop? If defect-only -> C_2 = 24/11 (reproducing S272). If full SM -> C_2 = (44/3)(2/11) = 88/33 = 8/3 (different). The CW potential uses physical gauge boson masses, which depend on the full Q_EM.

## Open Questions

1. **Which Q_EM for CW loops?** (EQ-039): The physical CW potential uses gauge boson masses m^2_A(Pi) = g_A^2 f^2 |[T_A, Pi]|^2. The gauge coupling g_A and generator T_A are physical SM quantities that include T_X. This suggests the full Q_EM is correct for the CW loop. If so, the structural derivation sum(Q^2)=12 (S272) does NOT directly equal the CW loop sum. Phase 2 must reconcile.

2. **Phase 2 next steps**: Construct the full m^2_A(Pi) for arbitrary Pi (not just EWSB VEV), compute V_CW at one-loop, extract the coefficient of the h^4 ln(h^2) term, compare to C_2 = 24/11.

3. **Factor-of-9 gap** (from S297): S_EM = 126 = 6*Im_H*Im_O generator charges vs 14 scalar charges. The discrepancy between defect-only (14) and full (50/3) partially addresses this.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 1 delivered the complete CCWZ infrastructure: 11x11 generators, SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R decomposition, T_X embedding, Goldstone matrix normalization, and gauge boson mass structure. The critical discovery is the two-convention charge system. Phase 2 should: (a) construct m^2_A(Pi) as an explicit function of the 28 pNGB fields, (b) compute V_CW at one loop, (c) determine whether the CW coefficient reproduces C_2 = 24/11. The Higgs VEV direction is T_{0,4} (index 0 paired with SU(3)-singlet index 4).
