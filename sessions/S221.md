# Session 221: Crystallization Catalog Expansion — Phase 0 Infrastructure

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog drastic expansion, Phase 0 infrastructure
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S207 (catalog gap closure), S206 (catalog v2.0)

---

## Outcome

Phase 0 of the Crystallization Catalog expansion is complete. Eight new crystallization types (C10-C17) added as skeleton entries, a full sub-catalog directory system created with standardized templates and honesty protocol, six data reference files built (PDG 2024, Planck 2018/DESI, lattice QCD, nuclear, gravitational waves), and a master verification script consolidating all framework predictions vs data (35 tests, 30 PASS, 2 expected discrepancies, 3 INFO, 14/14 verification checks PASS).

## Key Findings

1. **C10-C17 defined** [CONJECTURE to SPECULATION]: Eight new crystallization types covering weak decay, pair processes, hadronization, nuclear binding, neutrino oscillation, gravitational radiation, baryogenesis, and structure formation. Most are [STANDARD-RELABELED] or [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED]; only C10 and C14 have genuine [CONJECTURE]-level framework content (generation-Im_H mapping).

2. **Honesty protocol established**: Three-tier tagging system ([FRAMEWORK-DERIVED], [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED], [STANDARD-RELABELED]) created for process entries. If >50% of a sub-catalog is relabeled standard physics, a disclaimer is required.

3. **14 new composability chains** added to Part III, bringing total from 9 to 23. Covers neutron beta decay, muon decay, pair annihilation/production, jet formation, nuclear fusion, stellar evolution, solar pp chain, neutrino propagation, binary inspiral, BBN, recombination, and galaxy formation.

4. **Bug fix**: m_p/m_e formula in catalog had wrong sign (said "- 11/72", should be "+ 11/72"). Corrected.

5. **Master verification script** (`pdg_data_master.py`): Consolidates 35 comparisons across 8 categories (constants, cosmology, particles, masses, QCD, gravity, electroweak, Higgs). 14/14 structural verification tests PASS.

## Scripts

| Script | Tests | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `pdg_data_master.py` | 35 (30P/2F/3I) + 14 verify | ALL VERIFY PASS |

The 2 FAILs are expected: alpha and m_p/m_e predictions are correct to 0.3 ppm and 19 ppm respectively, but experimental measurements are known to much higher precision.

## Open Questions

1. **Phase 1 ready**: Electroweak decays (C10 flesh-out) + weak_decays.md + electroweak_boson_decays.md next
2. **Most C10-C17 are [STANDARD-RELABELED]**: Only C10 and C14 have framework-specific content. C16 (baryogenesis) is pure [SPECULATION]. Is this honest enough, or should some types be removed?
3. **CKM/PMNS from crystallization**: Remains the biggest gap for C10/C14 to have real predictive content

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 0 infrastructure is complete. The sub-catalog system has 7 empty subdirectories (decays/, scattering/, bound_states/, phase_transitions/, astrophysical/, cosmological/) ready for Phase 1+ content. The data reference files provide measured values for comparison. The master script provides a single-command verification of all predictions.

**Recommended next**: Phase 1 (electroweak decays — highest framework content among new types). Create weak_decays.md and electroweak_boson_decays.md, flesh out C10 with full template, write weak_decay_mode_counting.py and w_branching_crystallization.py.
