# Session S342: Launch C1a — Math Foundations Chunk 5 (Part V)

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Write Part V (Extended Results, Sections 17-20) of PC_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md
**Topic**: `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` Section 3.1a (Chunk 5 of 6)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S340 (Chunk 4: Part IV)
**Next**: Chunk 6 (Appendices A-D + final consistency review)

---

## Outcome

Part V complete. Document upgraded from v0.9 to v0.95 (~2100 lines total, ~400 new). Four sections written covering the glueball mass formula (CANONICAL Yang-Mills investigation), quantum mechanics from axioms (3 independent routes, 7 properties, zero interpretive assumptions), Einstein equations from Lovelock theorem + crystallization, and the tree-to-dressed correction band paradigm with 5 open problems. Zero TODOs.

## Key Findings

1. **Section 17: Glueball Mass Spectrum** [DERIVATION]
   - n_d=4 uniqueness theorem (algebraic: (n_d-1)(n_d-4)=0)
   - Casimir spectroscopy: 3 excitation costs from SO(n_d-1), transverse, SU(Im(H))
   - Elimination theorem: Im(H)=3 is unique gluon cost among 10 Casimir alternatives
   - Additive formula: m/sqrt(sigma) = n_d + J(J+1)/n_d + dim_C*L + Im(H)*(n_g-2)
   - SU(N) generalization: base n_d=4 universal, gluon cost = N
   - Large-N intercept = 10/3 = (Im(H)^2+1)/Im(H), chi^2=0.47 with 0 free params
   - Casimir product: C_2(F)*C_2(A) = n_d (unique at H->O in Cayley-Dickson)

2. **Section 18: Hilbert Space Structure from Axioms** [DERIVATION]
   - Route 1 (THM_0491): V_pi is finite-dim Hilbert over C from AXM_0113 + C5 + CCP
   - Route 2 (THM_04AC): Evaluation map gives linearity, continuity, completeness
   - Route 3 (THM_0494): Born rule from unique trace on M_2(C)
   - Unitary evolution from crystallization flow (skew-Hermitian generators)
   - All 7 QM properties (Hilbert, complex amp, Born, unitary, non-comm, uncertainty, quantized) derived
   - Zero interpretive assumptions (IRA-10 resolved S302)

3. **Section 19: Metric Dynamics from Crystallization** [DERIVATION]
   - Lovelock theorem [I-MATH]: n_d=4 + signature (1,3) uniquely forces Einstein tensor
   - Crystallization order parameter couples to metric via coset structure
   - Mexican hat potential -> ground state -> cosmological constant
   - Torsion = 0 from G_2 embedding -> GR not Einstein-Cartan

4. **Section 20: The Correction Band Hierarchy** [DERIVATION/CONJECTURE]
   - Three non-overlapping bands: A (184-1619 ppm), B (1.5-4.2 ppm), C (0.06-0.27 ppm)
   - Band membership predicted a priori by 3-step criterion (16/16)
   - Phi_6 cascade: algebraic depth -> prediction precision
   - 5 open problems: fermion mass hierarchy, CKM angles, CC magnitude, Band D, higher loops

## Open Questions

1. **Chunk 6 scope** (Appendices A-D): Full proofs of CONJ-A3 (Radon-Hurwitz, Appendix A), CONJ-B1 (FFT on Hom(R^4,R^7), Appendix B), CONJ-A1 (spectral convergence, Appendix C), plus verification script index (Appendix D). Final consistency review across all 20 sections.

2. **Section 17 depth**: Kept focused on key results (formula, uniqueness, SU(N), large-N) without the full O-channel crystallization narrative or Landau-Ginzburg formalization. These are interpretation-level and belong in the companion document.

## Key Context for Next Session

Part V extends the framework from numerical invariants (Part IV) to dynamical consequences: a mass spectrum (glueballs), foundational structures (QM, GR), and the systematic organization of all predictions (correction bands). The document is now v0.95 at ~2100 lines with 20 complete sections and zero TODOs. Chunk 6 (final) will add Appendices A-D with the detailed proofs of the three main conjectures (A3, B1, A1) and a verification script index, plus a final consistency pass. Target: v1.0 completion.
