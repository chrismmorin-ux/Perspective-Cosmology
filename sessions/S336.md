# Session S336: EQ-027 — Colored pNGB Branching Ratios and LHC Search Channels

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Colored pNGB representation decomposition, beta parameter, and LHC bounds reassessment
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: Complete
**Previous**: S326 (CW mass), S328 (U(1)_Y embedding), S329 (g_rho attempt)

## Outcome

Resolved EQ-027. The 24 colored pNGBs decompose into TWO complex SU(2)_L doublets with distinct hypercharges and phenomenology. Multiplet 1 is a standard R-tilde_2 leptoquark with beta_eff = 0.5 (forced by SU(2) doublet structure). Multiplet 2 is an exotic diquark with NO renormalizable SM coupling. At beta = 0.5, LHC bounds weaken from ~1500 to ~1220 GeV (3rd gen), giving m_col = 1761 GeV a 541 GeV margin — STRENGTHENING the S326 prediction.

## Key Findings

1. **Two colored multiplets from Pati-Salam chain** [DERIVATION]: SO(7) -> SO(6) ~ SU(4) -> SU(3) x U(1)_X gives T_X(3 in 7) = -1/3. Combined with T_{3,L(SO4)} = +/-1/2:
   - Multiplet 1: (2, Y=1/6, 3) = R-tilde_2 scalar leptoquark, 12 real DOF
   - Multiplet 2: (2, Y=-5/6, 3) = exotic diquark, 12 real DOF

2. **T_X on 7 vs 8 of SO(7)** [DERIVATION]: T_X(3 in 7) = -1/3 differs from T_X(3 in 8) = 1/6. The 7 decomposes as 6+1 under SO(6), with 6 = Lambda^2(4) giving 3bar_{1/3} + 3_{-1/3}. The 8 (spinor) gives 4+4bar with 4 -> 3_{1/6} + 1_{-1/2}. Both are traceless. All 6 SM fermion hypercharges derived correctly.

3. **Beta_eff = 0.5 for Multiplet 1** [DERIVATION]: SU(2)_L doublet structure forces: S^{2/3} -> d_R + l^+ (beta=1), S^{-1/3} -> d_R + nu (beta=0). Equal QCD pair production of both components gives beta_eff = 0.5. Robust against small EW mass splitting (~2%).

4. **Multiplet 2 has NO renormalizable LQ coupling** [DERIVATION]: Exhaustive check of all SM fermion bilinears in 2-component Weyl notation shows no gauge-invariant (2, 5/6, 3bar) combination. Only coupling: diquark S* -> Q_L + u_R (dijet final state). Constrained by paired dijet resonance searches (weaker bounds, ~1.0 TeV).

5. **LHC bounds STRENGTHENED** [DERIVATION]: At beta=0.5, 3rd gen bound ~1220 GeV vs m_col=1761 GeV gives +541 GeV margin. Compare S326 beta=1: +261 GeV margin. Improvement of 280 GeV. HL-LHC reach ~2200 GeV at beta=0.5 -> TESTABLE.

6. **Mass splitting ~2%** [DERIVATION]: EW correction from Y^2 difference (0.69 vs 0.03) gives M2 ~ 33 GeV heavier than M1. Small enough to not affect phenomenology significantly.

## Retractions

None. S328 retractions (S325 singlet/Y=0) already done; this session is consistent with S328.

## Open Questions

1. **Multiplet 2 lifetime** (NEW): With no renormalizable SM coupling, M2 decays through dimension-5 operators or composite dynamics. Could give displaced vertices or R-hadron signatures. Needs dedicated phenomenology study.
2. **Diquark coupling strength**: The M2 diquark coupling S* -> Q_L + u_R strength depends on composite sector dynamics. Could contribute to same-sign top production.
3. **Mass hierarchy** (from S325): Still OPEN — magnitude of generation mass ratios not derived.
4. **T_X admixture** (from S328): Y = T_{3,L(SO4)} + T_X confirmed (not pure L1). S328 Open Q2 partially resolved.

## Key Context for Next Session

S336 resolved EQ-027 with a clean result: two multiplets, not one. The key surprise is that M2 = (2, -5/6, 3) has NO standard leptoquark coupling — it's a diquark. This means only half the colored pNGBs (M1) appear in standard LQ searches, and M2 requires different searches (paired dijets, displaced vertices).

The beta_eff = 0.5 result is robust and STRENGTHENS the P-022 prediction: m_col = 1761 GeV has a comfortable 541 GeV margin above the beta=0.5 bound of ~1220 GeV. HL-LHC will be definitive (reach ~2.2 TeV). P-022 does NOT need revision — the mass prediction is unchanged and the bounds are weaker.

The Pati-Salam chain derivation of hypercharges is independent of S328's SO(4) analysis but consistent with it. Together they give a complete picture of the colored pNGB quantum numbers under SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y.
