# Session S301: Comprehensive S257-S299 Propagation

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Propagate S257-S299 results across framework documentation
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S299 (IRA reduction 8->6), S300 (stale, EQ-008)

---

## Outcome

Comprehensive propagation session. Updated 10+ framework files to reflect the transformative S257-S299 results: 5 conjecture resolutions, IRA reduction 10->6, Yang-Mills CANONICAL, tree-to-dressed paradigm, alpha C=24/11, Omega_m derived, top Yukawa y_t=1, Weinberg chain complete. No new calculations (propagation only).

## Key Actions

### Phase 2: Publication Updates (3 files)

1. **HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md** (v2.0 -> v2.3): Added 18 Key Derivation Advances, updated 5/5 Remaining Critical Gaps (resolved or partially resolved), added 2 new gaps (V_0 mechanism, Factor-9 gap), updated counts (~300 sessions, ~662 scripts, 6 IRA)
2. **TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md** (v2.2 -> v2.3): Rewrote Section 6.3 (Alpha Step 5), added Sections 6.4-6.6 (Radiative Corrections, Yang-Mills, Tree-to-Dressed), added Section 13.3 (IRA Inventory), updated Section 14 (5/6 gaps resolved), probability 20-35%
3. **THESIS.md** (v2.2 -> v2.3): Updated Alpha Step 5 status, IRA count, script count, probability

### Phase 3: Registry Updates (3 files)

4. **CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md** (110 sessions behind -> current): Added AXM_0120, 6 new theorems, comprehensive S251-S299 Key Results section (CCP, 5 conjecture resolutions, Yang-Mills, tree-to-dressed, alpha C=24/11, Omega_m, y_t=1, IRA inventory), ~19 new verification scripts
5. **derivations/INDEX.md** (122 sessions behind -> current): Added 8 session coverage blocks (S185-S299), updated gaps, fixed CC sign, script count ~662
6. **investigations/_INDEX.md**: Upgraded yang_mills_mass_gap.md to CANONICAL, updated topic counts

### Phase 4: Framework Files (2 files)

7. **THEORY_STRUCTURE.md**: Added header note pointing to current authoritative documents (too stale at S85 for full rewrite)
8. **foundations/THE_CHAIN.md**: Updated Step 7 (gauge groups) from [CONJECTURE] to [DERIVATION] with Pipeline route, added conjecture resolution summary

### Phase 5: Exploration Queue

9. **EXPLORATION_QUEUE.md**: Moved 11 resolved items from Active to Recently Resolved (EQ-001-005, 007, 009-010, 020, 022, 026, 038). Added EQ-002, EQ-003, EQ-038 to Recently Resolved with full details. Updated EQ-006 to SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED. Updated Scored View. Active count: 30->24.

## Investigation Opportunities Identified

1. **IRA-10 redundancy** (could reduce IRA 6->5): Can perspectives=QM be derived from IRA-07+THM_0491+THM_0494?
2. **Band A testable predictions** (1-2 sessions): Apply tree-to-dressed Band A to m_tau/m_mu, alpha_s
3. **EQ-002/003 duality extensions** (2-3 sessions): Does kappa=1 force additional constants beyond alpha + Omega_m?
4. **Factor-9 gap** (1 session): Why S_EM=126 vs sum(Q^2)_coset=14 = 9 = Im_H^2?
5. **V_0 mechanism** (EQ-011): Derive V_0=alpha^4/C from first principles
6. **Quaternion-Kahler quantization** (EQ-038 successor): State counting via Omega_4^7

## Key Context for Next Session

All major framework documentation is now current through S299. The three publication files (HONEST_ASSESSMENT, TECHNICAL_SUMMARY, THESIS) are at v2.3. CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES and derivations/INDEX are caught up after being 100+ sessions behind. Exploration queue cleaned: 24 active items remain, 3 newly resolved. Top priorities: EQ-008 (11/3 structural origin), EQ-039 (Band A predictions), EQ-011 (V_0 mechanism).
