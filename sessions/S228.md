# Session 228: Weinberg Angle — Emergent Gauge Coupling + RG Matching

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Formalize emergent gauge coupling assumption; resolve RG matching tension; assess κ=1 normalization
**Topic**: [Weinberg angle](../topics/weinberg-angle.md)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: [S224](S224.md) (Schur's lemma resolution)
**Next**: Step 6 formal adoption; composite sector RG calculation; or accept [A-PHYSICAL] and move on

---

## Outcome

Three directions investigated from S224. **Direction 1 (emergent coupling)**: Step 6 [A-PHYSICAL] CANNOT be derived from existing axioms — three distinct geometric mechanisms give three different values (28, 7, 21), and measurement selects democratic. **Direction 2 (RG tension)**: The tension is real (15:1 scale ratio) but not fatal — required BSM correction is only 0.36%, and colored pNGBs make it worse. **Direction 3 (κ=1)**: Subordinate to Step 6 — canonical normalization gives κ=1 automatically.

## Key Findings

1. **Three candidate gauge coupling mechanisms** [DERIVATION]: The sigma model on Gr(4,11) produces three distinct values depending on mechanism:
   - **Democratic/metric**: N = 28 (all tangent directions equal, from Schur's lemma) — matches measurement (0.34%)
   - **One-loop/Dynkin**: T = 7 (Dynkin-weighted, from perturbative QFT) — off by 71.3%
   - **Curvature/geometric**: C_L = 21 = Im_O × Im_H (curvature projection onto SU(2)_L) — off by 25%

   The democratic/Dynkin ratio is exactly **n_d = 4**. This is a new structural identity.

2. **Step 6 cannot be derived from axioms** [FINDING]: AXM_0109 (evaluation map), AXM_0110 (HS metric), and AXM_0117 (bilinear order parameter) produce the coset geometry and metric but do NOT determine which mechanism maps metric → gauge coupling. The democratic value requires adopting "gauge fields inherit vacuum manifold metric" as a separate physical principle.

3. **C_L = 21 = Im_O × Im_H is a third candidate** [DERIVATION]: Previously unnoticed. Each of the 6 SO(4) generators E^{ij} projects uniformly (|proj|² = 1/2) onto SU(2)_L. Total curvature coefficient: C_L = n_h × 3 = 21, where 3 = dim(su(2)_L). This is neither democratic (28) nor Dynkin (7).

4. **RG tension is real but not fatal** [DERIVATION]: SM one-loop running from tree-level values gives Λ₂ = 2115 GeV vs Λ₃ = 141 GeV (ratio 15:1). The compositeness scale f = 1354 GeV sits between them. Running from f works for SU(2) (0.8% off) but not SU(3) (30% off).

5. **Colored pNGBs make RG tension worse** [FINDING]: Adding 24 colored pNGBs (12 triplets + 12 anti-triplets) at threshold pushes the scale ratio from 15:1 to 22-34:1. The composite sector (heavy resonances, top partners) must provide compensating corrections.

6. **Required BSM correction is tiny** [DERIVATION]: The RG factors ε₂ = 5.66%, ε₃ = 6.02%, ε_EM = 5.75% have spread 0.34% relative to full (1+ε). This 0.36% deficit is much smaller than typical threshold corrections (~few percent). Plausibly achievable by full composite sector.

7. **κ=1 is subordinate to Step 6** [ANALYSIS]: Once Step 6 is adopted (gauge coupling from metric), canonical normalization of Goldstone fields gives κ=1 automatically. The 1/n_c from HS metric cancels with n_c from trace normalization. Not a separate assumption.

## Open Questions

1. **Adopt Step 6 as formal principle?** (EQ-007/EQ-022): The gap is now precisely characterized. Three options: (a) adopt as falsifiable [A-PHYSICAL], (b) seek deeper derivation from information theory / holography, (c) leave as open tension.
2. **Full composite sector RG calculation** (EQ-007): Could heavy resonances + top partners resolve the 0.36% spread? Requires specific composite sector spectrum (blocked on EQ-006 top Yukawa).
3. **Framework expression for ε_avg**: Im_H/(n_d×n_c + n_h) = 1/17 ≈ 5.88% is 1.3% from measured average 5.81%. Coincidence or structural?

## Key Context for Next Session

S228 conclusively showed that the Weinberg angle derivation chain has one irreducible physical assumption: **Step 6 [A-PHYSICAL] — emergent gauge fields inherit the vacuum manifold metric**. This cannot be derived from AXM_0109/0110/0117. Three geometric mechanisms on Gr(4,11) give three different gauge couplings (28, 7, 21), and only the democratic value matches observation. The RG tension (15:1 scale ratio) is real but the required correction (0.36%) is small enough to be plausibly resolved by the full composite sector. The κ=1 normalization is not a separate issue — it follows from Step 6 + canonical normalization. The main decision is whether to formally adopt Step 6 as a framework principle or continue seeking a deeper derivation.
