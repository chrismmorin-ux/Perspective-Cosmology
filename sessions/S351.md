# Session S351: Launch Phase 2 — Derivation Chain Viewer (W6)

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: W6 Derivation Chain Viewer for the website
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Outcome Summary

Built the Derivation Chain Viewer — an interactive React island at `/explore/derivations` that visualizes the full derivation graph from axioms to predictions as a layered DAG.

## Deliverables

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| W6: Derivation Chain Viewer | COMPLETE | React island with SVG-based layered DAG. 5 predefined chains. Click nodes for detail panel. Hover for edge highlighting. |
| derivation-graph.json | COMPLETE | 49 nodes, 83 edges. Covers axioms, theorems, definitions, predictions, imports, assumptions. 5 curated chains. |
| Build verification | COMPLETE | 10 pages, 0 errors, 2.95s. Component: 9.4 KB (3.0 KB gzip). |
| Visual verification | COMPLETE | Verified via Playwright (dev server). Alpha chain, Omega_m chain, node detail panel all working. |

## Files Created

- `website/data/derivation-graph.json` — Structured graph data (49 nodes, 83 edges, 5 chains)
- `website/src/components/DerivationChainViewer.tsx` — React island component

## Files Modified

- `website/src/pages/explore/derivations.astro` — Replaced stub with live component
- `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` — W6 status updated, session history added

## Technical Notes

- **No new dependencies**: Pure React + SVG. No D3 or external graph library needed.
- **Layout**: Custom layered DAG algorithm. Nodes grouped by layer (0-8), centered horizontally.
- **Interactivity**: Click node -> detail panel with description, dependencies, used-by, verification script. Hover -> highlight connected edges/nodes, dim unconnected.
- **5 chains**: Alpha (28 nodes), Weinberg (16 nodes), Omega_m (11 nodes), SM Gauge (16 nodes), QM (14 nodes).
- **Node types**: axiom (blue), theorem (green), definition (amber), prediction (purple), import (orange), assumption (yellow).
- **Edge tags**: [A] from axiom (blue), [I] import (orange), [D] derived (green) — with colored arrows.
- **Preview mode issue**: `jsxDEV is not a function` in Astro preview mode. Dev server and production build both work fine. Known Astro 5 + React 19 preview mode issue.

## Verification Scripts

No new SymPy scripts (website session).

## Open Questions

- Preview mode hydration error (cosmetic, production build works)
- Could add more chains (Einstein equations, inflation, dark matter)
- Node labels truncate at 18 chars — could add tooltip on hover

## Key Context for Next Session

Website Phase 2 is now **7/10 deliverables complete** (W2-W6, W8 + landing page). Remaining: W7 (Division algebra visualizer), W9 (Verification portal), W10 (Blog). W9 is highest priority of the remaining items. The Prediction Explorer at /explore already links to derivation chains via "View derivation chain" in expanded cards.
