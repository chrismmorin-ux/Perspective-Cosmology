# Session 173 — Born Rule: WF Uniqueness and Robustness

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Focus**: Derive Wright-Fisher noise uniqueness from crystallization axioms (CR-035 follow-up)
**Topic**: `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S169 (WF existence from perturbation analysis)

---

## Outcome

Proved that Wright-Fisher covariance is the **unique** degree-2 face-invariant exchangeable diffusion on the simplex, and that the Born rule is **robust** to any noise amplitude. This completes the three-layer derivation structure for THM_0494.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: WF Uniqueness Theorem [DERIVATION]
The most general degree-2 exchangeable covariance on the n-simplex has 8 free parameters (3 diagonal coefficients, 5 off-diagonal). Exchangeability reduces to 3. The simplex constraint (sum dp_k = 0) reduces to 2 parameters (C, D). Face invariance (AXM_0110: when p_k = 0, component k decouples) forces D = 0. The surviving one-parameter family is:

```
Sigma_{ij} = C * p_i(delta_{ij} - p_j)
```

This is Wright-Fisher up to overall scale C.

**Axiom chain**: AXM_0110 (orthogonality) + AXM_0112 (symmetry) + simplex constraint + I-MATH (polynomial classification).

### Finding 2: Born Rule Robustness [DERIVATION]
For any zero-drift diffusion dp_k = h(p_k) dB_k with absorbing faces, the exit probability u(p) = p satisfies the backward Kolmogorov equation **regardless** of h(p). This is because u'' = 0 has the linear solution u(p) = p for any diffusion coefficient. The Born rule therefore holds for the entire family of face-invariant exchangeable diffusions, not just WF specifically.

### Finding 3: Anomalous Term Analysis [DERIVATION]
Without face invariance, a second parameter D survives, giving Sigma_{kk}|_{p_k=0} = D*(s_2 - 1) which is nonzero on the interior of simplex faces. Face invariance (AXM_0110) uniquely kills this term.

### Finding 4: Degree-3 Corrections [DERIVATION]
A face-invariant exchangeable degree-3 covariance exists:
- Sigma_{ii}^(3) = eps * p_i(2p_i^2 - p_i - s_2)
- Sigma_{ij}^(3) = eps * p_ip_j(p_i + p_j)

This correction satisfies all simplex, symmetry, and face invariance constraints but does NOT affect the Born rule (robustness theorem applies).

## Open Questions

1. **THM_0491 and THM_0493 are SKETCH**: The Born rule derivation is conditional on Hilbert space and unitary evolution being promoted. These are the remaining bottleneck.
2. **Physical interpretation of degree-3 corrections**: Do they correspond to any observable effect? (Probably not — they vanish in the continuum limit.)
3. **Non-polynomial diffusions**: The uniqueness proof covers polynomial covariance. Could there be non-polynomial face-invariant diffusions that violate Born rule? (Robustness theorem says no — any zero-drift absorbing diffusion gives Born rule.)

---

## Key Context for Next Session

The Born rule derivation now has three layers of support:
- **S169**: WF noise EXISTS (derived from Hermitian perturbation + phase symmetry)
- **S173**: WF noise is UNIQUE at degree 2 (from face invariance + exchangeability)
- **S173**: Born rule is ROBUST (holds for any noise amplitude, not just WF)

The weakest link is now upstream: THM_0491 (Hilbert space) and THM_0493 (unitary evolution) are both SKETCH. Promoting either would strengthen the entire chain.
