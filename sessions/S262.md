# Session S262: Alpha -- Framework vs Standard Formula + Radiative Gap

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Connection between framework alpha formula and standard physics formula; running coupling interpretation of 0.27 ppm gap
**Topic**: Alpha / constants
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S261 (LLM Challenge v3), S258 (CONJ-A3 proven), S260 (Planck constant)

## Outcome

**Three-part investigation of alpha**: (1) Framework formula vs standard physics formula alpha = e^2/(4*pi*eps_0*hbar*c) -- mapped all 5 standard constants to framework origins. (2) Running coupling analysis -- standard QED running goes WRONG DIRECTION [THEOREM], cannot explain 0.27 ppm gap. (3) Discovered gap ~ 2*alpha^2/pi [SPECULATION] -- 12x improvement to 0.022 ppm; self-consistent depressed cubic; loop hierarchy consistent with QFT; coefficient C ~ 24/11 (0.08% from exact).

## Key Findings

1. **[THEOREM] Framework prediction NOT within measurement error**: 1/alpha = 15211/111 = 137.036036... vs measured 137.035999084. Gap = 0.27 ppm (~1759 sigma). Remarkably close for zero free parameters, but not within experimental precision (0.15 ppb).

2. **[DERIVATION] Standard formula constants map to framework**: c -> dim(H)=4 (3+1 split), hbar -> forced by pi^2=pi + F=C + quaternionic, e -> NOT fundamental (derived from alpha=1/N_I), eps_0 -> unit artifact, 4*pi -> S^2 area in Im_H=3. Key reversal: standard physics treats e as fundamental; framework treats alpha as fundamental.

3. **[THEOREM] Standard QED running cannot explain the gap**: Vacuum polarization makes alpha stronger at higher energy (1/alpha decreases). Running DOWN from compositeness scale INCREASES 1/alpha -- wrong direction. Framework already overshoots.

4. **[SPECULATION] Gap ~ 2*alpha^2/pi (two-loop scale)**: 2*alpha^2/pi = 0.0000339 vs gap = 0.0000370 (within 9%). With C = dim(C) = 2, corrected 1/alpha = 137.036002, gap reduced to 0.022 ppm (12x improvement).

5. **[SPECULATION] Self-consistent equation is depressed cubic**: 1/alpha + 2*alpha^2/pi = 15211/111 becomes 2a^3 - (15211*pi/111)*a + pi = 0. No a^2 term. Algebraically the simplest possible cubic. Three real roots, one physical.

6. **[DERIVATION] Loop hierarchy is QFT-consistent**: sin^2(theta_W) gap (0.08%) is one-loop scale alpha/pi. Alpha gap (0.00003%) is two-loop scale alpha^2/pi. This ordering EXACTLY matches what QFT predicts for tree-level values at the compositeness scale.

7. **[SPECULATION] Exact coefficient C = 2.180 ~ 24/11**: The remainder C - 2 = 0.180 satisfies 0.180 * n_c = 1.98 ~ 2. So C ~ 2(n_c+1)/n_c = 24/11 = 2.18182, within 0.08% of the exact value. Why (n_c+1)/n_c would appear is an open question.

## Open Questions

1. **EQ-039**: Derive the 2*alpha^2/pi correction from framework axioms. Need perspective fluctuation theory or crystallization loop expansion.
2. **Why C ~ 24/11?**: Is it 2(n_c+1)/n_c? What physical mechanism produces the n_c-dependent coefficient?
3. **Apply tree->dressed paradigm**: Test the correction structure on sin^2(theta_W), particle masses, other quantities.
4. **Depressed cubic origin**: Can 2a^3 - (15211*pi/111)*a + pi = 0 be derived from Lie algebra structure?
5. **Residual 0.022 ppm**: Does it encode further structure?

## Key Context for Next Session

The session explored the connection between the framework's simple alpha formula (1/alpha = 4^2 + 11^2 + 4/111) and the standard physics formula (alpha = e^2/(4*pi*eps_0*hbar*c)). All five constants in the standard formula map to framework structures -- the framework works at a deeper level, counting Lie algebra generators rather than combining measured dimensional quantities.

The 0.27 ppm gap between framework and measurement CANNOT be explained by standard QED running (wrong sign -- proven). However, the gap matches 2*alpha^2/pi to 9%, a natural two-loop QED correction scale. The self-consistent equation 1/alpha + C*alpha^2/pi = 15211/111 (with C ~ 2 or more precisely ~ 24/11) gives a depressed cubic with a physical root at 1/alpha = 137.036002, within 0.022 ppm of measurement.

The strongest structural argument is the LOOP HIERARCHY: sin^2(theta_W) has a one-loop-scale gap (0.08% ~ alpha/pi), while alpha has a two-loop-scale gap (0.00003% ~ alpha^2/pi). This is exactly what QFT predicts for tree-level values corrected by radiative effects. This upgrades the observation from "numerical coincidence" to "structurally motivated conjecture."

Three promising next directions: (a) derive the correction from perspective fluctuations, (b) test the tree->dressed paradigm on other predictions, (c) investigate the C ~ 24/11 coefficient structure.
