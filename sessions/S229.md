# Session 229: Crystallization Catalog Expansion -- Phase 4 Phase Transitions

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog Phase 4: phase transition sub-catalogs and verification
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S227 (Phase 3 bound states)

## Outcome

Phase 4 of the Crystallization Catalog expansion is complete. Three phase transition sub-catalog files created: `ewsb_detailed.md` (4 processes: EWSB coset structure, Higgs vacuum alignment, W/Z mass generation, fermion mass generation), `qcd_phase_diagram.md` (4 processes: confinement/deconfinement crossover, QGP formation, chiral symmetry restoration, color superconductivity), and `bbn_nucleosynthesis.md` (4 processes: neutron freeze-out, deuterium bottleneck, helium-4 synthesis, lithium-7). One new verification script `phase_transition_crystallization.py` (16/16 PASS) covering EWSB vacuum parameters, QCD structural inputs, and BBN parameters. C7 fleshed out from skeleton to full entry with sub-catalog references, expanded observables table, and EWSB/BBN derivation chains. C2 updated with EWSB sub-catalog cross-reference. Catalog updated v3.3 -> v3.4 (56 scripts, 695 tests).

## Key Findings

1. **EWSB sub-catalog: 1/4 [FRAMEWORK-DERIVED], 3/4 [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED]** [strongest phase transition domain]: The Gr(4,11) coset structure genuinely constrains EWSB physics: xi = 4/121, sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121 (0.08% from PDG), kappa_V = sqrt(117/121), spinorial embedding (MCHM4) giving universal kappa_f = kappa_V. This is the only sub-catalog where a process entry achieves [FRAMEWORK-DERIVED] status.

2. **QCD phase diagram: 4/4 [STANDARD-RELABELED]** [honest assessment]: Framework provides N_c = Im_H = 3 as the single structural input, determining crossover order for N_f = 2+1 and QGP gluon DOF. T_c = 156.5 MeV is not derived (gap). All quantitative content imported from lattice QCD.

3. **BBN nucleosynthesis: 2/4 [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED]** [limited content]: N_nu = Im_H = 3 enters freeze-out through g_* = 10.75, affecting Y_p ~ 0.247. This is a consistency check, not a novel prediction. Deuterium bottleneck and lithium-7 are purely [STANDARD-RELABELED]. Lithium problem unaddressed.

4. **Neutrino DOF counting bug caught and fixed**: Initial g_* calculation overcounted neutrino DOF (treating them as non-chiral with 2 spin x 2 particle/anti = 4 DOF per species instead of correct 1 helicity x 2 particle/anti = 2 DOF per species). Fixed before final script run.

5. **C7 now fully documented**: Expanded from skeleton to comprehensive entry with 8 observables (including sin^2 from Gr(4,11), kappa_V, N_eff, Y_p), 8 verification scripts, 3 sub-catalog references, and EWSB/QCD/BBN derivation chains.

## Open Questions

1. **T_c(QCD) derivation** (EQ-related): The QCD phase transition temperature T_c ~ 156.5 MeV is not derived. It should follow from O-channel barrier height in the crystallization potential, but no calculation exists. This is marked MEDIUM in the gap tracker.
2. **xi = 4/121 mechanism** (EQ-004/EQ-007): The EWSB misalignment parameter xi = n_d/n_c^2 is [CONJECTURE]. The "why democratic?" question (resolved in part by Schur's lemma in S224, but residual [A-PHYSICAL] gap remains) is the key open issue.
3. **Lithium problem**: Framework has nothing to say about the ~3x BBN-observation discrepancy in Li-7 abundance. Not a framework-specific gap, but noted for completeness.
4. **Phase 5 ready**: Astrophysical processes (stellar, compact objects, GWs) are next if catalog expansion continues.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 4 phase transitions complete. The `phase_transitions/` subdirectory now has 3 files with 12 process entries covering EWSB (strongest: xi, sin^2, kappa_V all verified), QCD (weakest: all [STANDARD-RELABELED]), and BBN (limited: N_nu = 3 only). The sub-catalog system now totals 9 files, 40 process entries, and 5 dedicated verification scripts (79/79 PASS). Catalog v3.4 (56 scripts, 695 tests). EWSB is the clear highlight — the only phase transition domain where the framework provides genuinely non-trivial content through the Gr(4,11) coset structure.

**Recommended next**: Phase 5 (astrophysical processes) or return to physics investigations (EQ-004 xi mechanism, EQ-006 top Yukawa, EQ-003 coset geometry).
