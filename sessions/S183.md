# Session 183 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Derive speed of light c from crystallization axioms
**Topic**: Spacetime / causality
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S182 (Phase 1/2 algebraic structure)

---

## Outcome

Derived c = 1 (in natural units) from Crystal isotropy axiom C2 via a 10-step chain. The core argument is a reductio: if c != 1, the Euclidean metric on H would be anisotropic, contradicting the Crystal inner product. Goldstone modes from symmetry breaking propagate at exactly this speed. Huygens' principle holds because Im(H) = 3 is odd. 21/21 verification tests PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **c = 1 from Crystal isotropy** [DERIVATION]: Wick rotation changes the sign of the time component but not its magnitude. Since g_E = diag(1,1,1,1) by C2, after Wick rotation |g_tt| = |g_xx| = 1, so c^2 = 1. Proof by contradiction: c != 1 => g_E anisotropic => contradiction with AXM_0110.

2. **Two dynamics distinction** [DERIVATION]: Order parameter eps follows first-order gradient flow (diffusive, no finite propagation speed). Goldstone modes phi follow second-order wave equation (propagation at c). The user's intuition "c = speed of crystallization" is correct in the sense that c is the speed at which perturbations of the crystallized vacuum propagate.

3. **Huygens' principle from Im(H) = 3** [DERIVATION]: Sharp wavefront propagation (no afterglow) holds iff spatial dimensions are odd and >= 3. Since Im(H) = 3, signals propagate cleanly at exactly ct. This is a bonus result from the 3+1 structure.

4. **Hyperbolicity gives finite speed** [DERIVATION]: Lorentzian signature => hyperbolic PDE => finite propagation speed. This is HOW finiteness of c enters — the Wick rotation converts parabolic (infinite speed) to hyperbolic (finite speed).

5. **Gap G6 identified** [PARTIAL]: The identification R = time direction in H is motivated by gradient flow aligning with the identity element but not rigorously proven. Shared with the Lorentz signature derivation.

## Open Questions

1. **Gap G6**: Why does the gradient flow direction align with R in H? Needs formal proof that identity element = time direction.
2. **Gap G4**: Discrete-to-continuum transition — how does the finite graph become a smooth manifold? (Shared with all continuum physics.)
3. **Gap G5**: Can finiteness of c be derived directly from the discrete structure without going through the continuum limit? (Depends on G4.)
4. **Anisotropy bounds**: Current experimental bounds on c anisotropy are < 10^-18. Could the framework predict tiny corrections from discrete structure?

## Key Context for Next Session

The speed of light derivation is complete at [DERIVATION] confidence. The strongest part is the reductio argument (Step 7): c != 1 contradicts Crystal isotropy. The weakest link is G6 (R = time). Gaps G4/G5 affect all continuum physics, not just this derivation. The investigation file lives at `framework/investigations/spacetime/speed_of_light_derivation.md` and uses 6 axioms (AXM_0109, 0110, 0112, 0113, 0117, 0119) plus 5 standard math imports.
