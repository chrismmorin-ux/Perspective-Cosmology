# Session 248: CNH Phase 2 — CCF Denominator, Observational Tests, Selection Rule

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: CNH Phase 2 — CCF denominator, He-3 test, norm/non-norm selection rule
**Topic**: CNH / prime attractors (continuation of S244, S246)
**Status**: ALL 5 TASKS COMPLETE — CCF denominator resolved [DERIVATION]
**Previous**: S246 (CNH deep investigation)

---

## Outcome

Resolved the CCF denominator problem (why divide by 3) via a mathematical theorem about multiplicative vs additive independence of Gaussian norms. Assessed He-3 as an observational test (NOT viable — PDG says 3He inappropriate as cosmological probe). Classified 19 framework formulas by norm/non-norm pattern (suggestive but not a selection rule). Analyzed EQ-002 via CNH (classification, not derivation). Verified squared non-norm phenomenon.

## Key Findings

1. **[DERIVATION] CCF denominator = 3 is forced**: The Gaussian norm indicator I(n) is determined by prime factorization (multiplicative), while N = A - Z is additive. Since multiplicative properties are NOT preserved under addition/subtraction, I(N) is independent of I(A) and I(Z). All 8 binary triples in {0,1}^3 realized among physical nuclei. P(norm_N | norm_A, norm_Z) ~ 0.44-0.48 for ALL conditioning values. Denominator 2 (any pair) gives WRONG Li-7 suppression (0 or 1/2, not 1/3). **This resolves AXM_0118 adoption criterion #5.**

2. **[CONJECTURE] Connection 3 = Im_H is motivated but not derived**: The 3 nuclear quantum numbers (baryon number, charge, isospin) correspond to 3 conserved charges. In the framework these come from Im_H = 3 imaginary quaternion directions. Each provides an independent crystallization channel. But this mapping is not derived from axioms.

3. **[BLOCKED] He-3 observational test NOT viable**: PDG (2019, 2022) states 3He is "inappropriate to use as a cosmological probe." Stellar contamination dominates; only upper bounds exist. Standard BBN: 3He/H = (1.04 +/- 0.04) x 10^-5. Bania+ 2002: (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^-5 (upper bound). CNH prediction: (2/3)(1.04) x 10^-5 = 0.69 x 10^-5 (~2-sigma below Bania, but observation is upper bound). D/H complication noted but mechanism unclear.

4. **[CONJECTURE] Norm/non-norm selection rule — suggestive, not predictive**: Classified 19 formulas: norm/norm (7), norm/NON (8), NON/norm (2), NON/NON (2). Pattern: NON/norm = fractional observables (sin^2 theta_W, Omega_m); norm/NON = suppression terms (Li-7, 1/alpha correction). But mixing angles scatter across categories — not sharp enough for a selection rule.

5. **[CONJECTURE] EQ-002 via CNH — classification, not derivation**: Omega_m = 63/200 = non-norm/norm. 63 = 7 x 3^2 (inert prime 7 at odd power = non-crystalline). 200 = 2^3 x 5^2 (all split/ramified = crystalline). 137 + 63 = 200 (alpha prime + matter = total). CNH provides a why-classification but not a mechanism.

6. **[CONJECTURE] Squared non-norm phenomenon verified**: 3^2=9, 7^2=49, 11^2=121 are all norms (trivially: inert prime to even power). In formulas, inert primes at ODD power signal non-crystalline content; at EVEN power they "crystallize." Consistent across all examined formulas.

## Open Questions

1. **Im_H = 3 structural connection** (EQ-NEW candidate): Can the mapping {A, Z, N} <-> Im_H directions be derived from axioms, or is it just dimensional coincidence?
2. **Meson CCF denominator**: Would mesons (2 quantum numbers) have CCF denominator = dim(C) = 2? Untestable in BBN but a structural prediction.
3. **He-3 future test**: A measurement technique bypassing stellar contamination could test the CNH. Not available currently.
4. **Selection rule sharpening**: The norm/non-norm pattern might become a rule if formulas are expressed in canonical form (reduced fractions from D_framework). Worth revisiting if more formulas are added.

## Key Context for Next Session

The CCF denominator problem is RESOLVED at [DERIVATION] level — the answer is the multiplicative-vs-additive independence of Gaussian norms. This clears AXM_0118 adoption criterion #5. The He-3 test is blocked by observational limitations (PDG says inappropriate). The norm/non-norm selection rule is a diagnostic tool, not a predictive rule. EQ-002 gains a classification (non-norm = matter, norm = dark energy) but not a derivation. The CNH now has 65/65 tests across 3 scripts (S244: 17, S246: 22, S248: 26). The remaining adoption criterion for AXM_0118 replacement is #4: independent prediction confirmed. Li-6 (CCF=0) or B-11 (CCF=1/3) remain the best candidates but are not observationally accessible near-term.
