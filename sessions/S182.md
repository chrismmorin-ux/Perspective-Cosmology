# Session 182 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Phase 1 completion + Phase 2 (Algebraic Structure Promotion)
**Topic**: Formalization plan execution
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S181 (Phase 0: G-004 resolution)
**Next**: Phase 3 (QM chain) or Phase 4 (Particles) — see open questions

---

## Outcome

Completed Phase 1 (Foundation Cleanup) remaining items and made substantial Phase 2 (Algebraic Structure) progress. Key achievements: THM_0487 promoted SKETCH→DERIVATION, G-006 categorical gap RESOLVED, conflicts C-002/C-003 RESOLVED, and honest assumption classifications added to 4 foundational documents.

## Key Findings

### Phase 1 Completion

1. **AXM_0100 (Finiteness) — Keep as AXIOM** [THEOREM → rejected]
   Layer 0 independence: |P|<∞ is logically prior to the division algebra chain (Layer 1). n_c=11 is a Layer 1 consequence, not a replacement for the finiteness postulate. S140 audit question resolved.

2. **AXM_0105 (Locality) — Formalized** [A-AXIOM]
   Added propagation interpretation: A(x) = f(Γ-paths(p,x)). Honest assessment: constrains what A depends on (Γ-paths only) but not how. Underdetermined is acknowledged.

3. **Conflicts C-002, C-003 — Both RESOLVED**
   - C-002: A (access map, not injective) vs T (transition, invertible) are different mathematical objects. Not a conflict.
   - C-003: AXM_0115 (algebraic completeness, all transitions) vs AXM_0107 (time direction, ΔI≥0 subset). Physical subset selection, not a conflict.

### Phase 2 Progress

4. **THM_0487 (SO(11) breaking chain) — SKETCH → DERIVATION** [D]
   Full proof written with 5 steps for Stage 1. c₃ > 0 from block stability: d²[ΔTr(ε⁴)]/dδ² = 24a² > 0 (verified via SymPy-MCP). Assumption classification: 10 components tagged. Honest assessment: DERIVATION not THEOREM because Landau expansion is [A-STRUCTURAL].

5. **G-006 (Z₂ → U(1) categorical gap) — RESOLVED**
   Automorphism path SUPERSEDED by stabilizer path. SO(4) → Stab_{SO(4)}(J) = U(2) = SU(2)×U(1) via Kähler form. All three automorphism gaps (Z₂→U(1), SO(3)→SU(2), G₂→SU(3)) closed by the stabilizer approach (THM_0487 Stages 2-4).

6. **3+1 split — Honest assessment added** [CONJECTURE]
   n_d=4 is [THEOREM]. H = R ⊕ Im_H is [I-MATH]. R = time is [A-PHYSICAL, CONJECTURE]. Lorentz signature is [A-IMPORT]. Fixed non-canonical n_c decomposition (was R+C+O=1+2+8, now Im_C+Im_H+Im_O=1+3+7).

7. **Chirality mechanism — Assessed, already at DERIVATION** [D]
   Three verification scripts exist. Chain: T1 → H orientation → φ_L embedding → Im_H maps to su(2)_L → left-handed weak coupling. Remaining gaps: formal orientation-preserving definition (minor).

## Open Questions

1. **Phase 3 readiness**: THM_0491 (Hilbert space) is already CANONICAL. THM_0493 (unitary evolution) is DERIVATION. THM_0494 (Born rule) is DERIVATION. Are there remaining QM chain items to promote, or is Phase 3 essentially at ceiling?

2. **Phase 4 priority**: The alpha chain audit (4A.1, CR-041) and mass formula audit (4B) are the highest-impact Phase 4 items. Which should be tackled first?

3. **AXM_0118 (prime attractor selection)**: Still PROPOSED with open questions. This is Phase 1A.2 — partially addressed by existing documentation but the three open questions about denominator selection remain unresolved. Severity: MEDIUM.

4. **Landau expansion derivation**: What would promote THM_0487 to THEOREM? Deriving the quartic form from tilt matrix structure, or proving c₃ > 0 without assuming block stability. Both are open research questions, not documentation tasks.

## Key Context for Next Session

Session 182 completed Phase 1 (Foundation Cleanup) and made substantial Phase 2 progress. The formalization plan's Phase 0 (G-004, S181) and Phase 1 are now DONE. Phase 2 is largely done — remaining items (Lorentz signature, chirality) are at their honest ceiling (CONJECTURE and DERIVATION respectively).

The plan calls for Phase 3 (QM chain, 5-7 sessions) next, but the QM chain is already in good shape (THM_0491 CANONICAL, THM_0493+0494 DERIVATION). The most impactful next work is likely Phase 4 (Particle Physics Audit) or Phase 7 (Statistical Validation), which the plan allows in parallel after the foundation is solid.

**Plan progress**: Phase 0 ✓, Phase 1 ✓, Phase 2 ~85% (at ceiling for remaining items). Ready for Phases 3-6 (parallel).
