# Session 240: Crossed Casimir Coupling — First-Principles Derivation Attempt

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: EQ-012 final gap — derive w_l = (-1)^(l+1) * C_2(Im_H - l) from first principles
**Topic**: `topics/casimir-crystallization.md` / EQ-012
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S235 (SO(3) decomposition, crossed Casimir formula discovery)
**Next**: Accept as [CONJECTURE with structural support]; magnitude gap is the single remaining element

---

## Outcome

Partial derivation achieved. The **sign pattern** of the crossed Casimir formula is **[DERIVATION]** from the Killing form of gl(3,R). The **magnitude** |w_l| = C_2(complementary irrep) remains **[CONJECTURE]**. Constraint analysis shows the formula is uniquely selected by 4 constraints, but two of those constraints (Frobenius norm, product) are themselves conjectural.

---

## Key Findings

1. **[DERIVATION] Sign from Killing form**: gl(3,R) Killing form K(X,Y) = 6·Tr(XY) - 2·Tr(X)·Tr(Y). On V_1 (antisymmetric, compact): K = -6||M||² < 0. On V_2 (symmetric traceless, non-compact): K = +6||S||² > 0. Weight sign = sign of -K: V_1 positive, V_2 negative. This correctly produces (-1)^(l+1) for l=1,2.

2. **[MATH FACT] Commutator coupling is irrep-blind**: Within M_3(R), the commutator coupling η_l = ||[M_l, G]||² gives η_1 = η_2 = 6 for both V_1 and V_2 modes (from Killing form identity). Commutator coupling alone CANNOT distinguish irreps or produce negative weights.

3. **[DERIVATION] Constraint system**: Four constraints determine w uniquely:
   - C1: w_0 = 1 (scalar baseline) [DERIVATION: U(1) trace coupling]
   - C2: Σ dim_l · w_l = 9 = Im_H² (completeness) [DERIVATION: Born-rule budget]
   - C3: Σ dim_l · w_l² = 129 = Im_H · Φ_6(Im_O) (Frobenius norm) [CONJECTURE]
   - C4: Π w_l = -12 = -n_d · Im_H (product) [CONJECTURE]
   C1+C2 leave 1 free parameter. Adding C3 gives 2 discrete solutions: {1,6,-2} and {1,-4,4}. C4 selects {1,6,-2} uniquely.

4. **[CONJECTURE] Magnitude gap**: Why |w_l| = C_2(3-l) specifically? The commutator structure shows [V_l, V_l'] lands in specific irreps, but the coupling STRENGTH through the complementary Casimir eigenvalue has no first-principles derivation. This is the single remaining unexplained element.

5. **Anti-correlation confirmed**: Killing form sign and complementary Casimir are perfectly anti-correlated: compact (K<0) ↔ higher C_2, non-compact (K>0) ↔ lower C_2. This is structural but not explanatory.

## Assessment

**EQ-012 status update**: The crossed Casimir formula is now understood at [CONJECTURE with strong structural support]:
- Sign: DERIVED (Killing form of gl(3,R))
- Scalar baseline: DERIVED (trace coupling)
- Sum constraint: DERIVED (Born-rule completeness)
- Magnitude: CONJECTURE (complementary Casimir — no mechanism)
- Frobenius norm: CONJECTURE (why Im_H · Φ_6(Im_O)?)
- Product: CONJECTURE (why -n_d · Im_H?)

The formula is uniquely determined by constraints, but two of four constraints lack derivations. Closing the magnitude gap would require either:
1. Deriving the Frobenius norm from Born-rule dynamics
2. Finding a representation-theoretic identity forcing |w_l| = C_2(l') for crossed irreps
3. Connecting to the alpha correction mechanism (which also uses [T,G] commutator coupling)

---

## Open Questions

1. **(EQ-012)**: Can the Frobenius norm Σ dim_l · w_l² = 129 be derived from crystallization dynamics?
2. **(EQ-012)**: Is there a representation-theoretic identity that forces complementary Casimir coupling in SO(3) decompositions of endomorphism algebras?
3. **(NEW)**: The commutator coupling η_1 = η_2 = 6 being identical for both non-trivial irreps — does this have deeper significance? It means the Killing form is the ONLY mechanism that distinguishes V_1 from V_2.

## Key Context for Next Session

S240 attempted to derive the crossed Casimir formula from first principles. The sign pattern (-1)^(l+1) was successfully derived from the compact/non-compact split of gl(3,R)'s Killing form. The magnitude |w_l| = C_2(complementary irrep) remains conjectural. The constraint system {w_0=1, sum=9, Frobenius=129, product=-12} uniquely determines the weights, but the Frobenius and product constraints themselves lack derivations. The formula should be classified as [CONJECTURE with structural support] — significantly stronger than arbitrary, but not fully derived. EQ-012 can be considered essentially complete at this level unless a new mechanism for the magnitude is found.
