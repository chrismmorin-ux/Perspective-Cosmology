# Session S308

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Band structure deep dive: predict band membership, 3-scale origin, Band D
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S307 (EQ-039: Coefficient unification + Band A predictions)
**Next**: Phi_6 cascade depth -> band mapping; strong dressing paradigm; mathematical depth -> precision formalization

## Outcome

Deep structural analysis of the band system produced three main results. (1) A 3-step structural criterion predicts band membership a priori for all 16 ratios: correction sector (QCD -> D), loop order (one-loop -> A), coefficient type (trace C>1 -> C, suppression C<1 -> B). 16/16 correct. (2) Three EM bands arise from 2 loop orders x coefficient dichotomy (3 non-empty cells). C=1 is the natural B/C boundary: trace enhancement vs dimensional suppression. (3) Band D is a feature: all gaps < alpha_s/pi, consistent with QCD-dominated corrections. Additionally identified deep mathematical correlations: the Phi_6 cascade mirrors band depth, the 121-28-137 triangle encodes bands A/A/C, and mathematical operation depth (quadratic > cyclotomic > linear > additive) correlates with prediction precision.

## Key Findings

1. **Band membership predicted a priori** [CONJECTURE]: Three structural properties determine the band: (a) dominant correction sector (EM vs QCD) separates D from A/B/C, (b) loop order separates A from B/C, (c) coefficient type (trace vs suppression) separates C from B. Prediction: 16/16 correct. Key signature of Band C: compositeness + End(V) trace involvement.

2. **Three EM scales from structural reasons** [CONJECTURE]: 2 loop orders (alpha/pi vs alpha^2/pi) x coefficient dichotomy (C>1 vs C<1) = 3 non-empty cells. C=1 is the natural B/C boundary (Koide sits exactly there). Band A/B gap set by 1/alpha (~137x). Band B/C gap set by coefficient ratio (~10-70x). Both have clean separations with no overlap.

3. **Band D is a feature** [CONJECTURE]: All Band D gaps < alpha_s/pi (~37500 ppm). Quark mass ratios and CKM elements have QCD-dominated corrections, so perturbative EM dressing correctly predicts it cannot address them. A parallel "strong dressing" paradigm could apply.

4. **Phi_6 cascade mirrors band depth** [DERIVATION/OBSERVATION]: Phi_6: 2->3->7->43->111 maps exactly to Cayley-Dickson tower dimensions AND to band-defining denominators. 43 appears in Band B denominators, 111 in Band C. The cascade depth correlates with precision.

5. **121-28-137 triangle** [DERIVATION]: These three numbers encode the band system: 121=End(V) in Band A denom, 28=coset in Band A numer, 137~alpha in Band C. Their sum 121+137=258 appears in Band D (|V_ub| denom). Band gets FINER as mathematical structure gets DEEPER.

6. **Mathematical depth -> precision** [SPECULATION]: Quadratic forms (n_d^2+n_c^2=137) -> sub-ppm. Cyclotomic evaluations (Phi_6) -> ppm. Linear products (n_d*Im_O=28) -> 100 ppm. Simple addition (121+137=258) -> percent-level.

## Open Questions

1. **Phi_6 cascade -> band mapping formalization** (EQ-039 extension): Can we prove that Phi_6 cascade depth DETERMINES band membership, not just correlates with it? The iterated map Phi_6: dim_C -> Im_H -> Im_O -> 43 -> 111 connects Cayley-Dickson levels to band-defining parameters.
2. **Strong dressing paradigm**: Can Band D quantities be systematically dressed with alpha_s/pi corrections and framework coefficients? Would need C_s values from QCD representation theory.
3. **Mathematical depth formalization**: The hierarchy quadratic > cyclotomic > linear > additive is intuitive but not rigorous. Can this be formalized as an algebraic complexity measure?
4. **C=1 boundary**: Koide's C=1 sits exactly at the B/C boundary. Is this structurally forced, or could Koide have C != 1?

## Key Context for Next Session

Band structure deep dive COMPLETE. Three structural results:
- Band prediction: 3-step algorithm (sector, loop order, coefficient type) gets 16/16 [CONJECTURE]
- Three scales: 2 loop orders x coefficient dichotomy, C=1 boundary [CONJECTURE]
- Band D: feature of QCD dominance, all gaps < alpha_s/pi [CONJECTURE]

Plus deep mathematical correlations: Phi_6 cascade = band depth, 121-28-137 triangle, operation-depth -> precision hierarchy [SPECULATION].

25/25 PASS (1 script). No propagation triggers (no status changes, retractions, or count changes).
