# Session S293: Omega_m Equipartition from HS Metric (EQ-002)

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: EQ-002 — derive equipartition mechanism for Omega_m = 63/200
**Topic**: `topics/cmb-physics.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S288 (unified origin 200=137+63, EQ-002/EQ-003 duality)

## Outcome

Derived the **equipartition mechanism** for Omega_m = 63/200 [DERIVATION conditioned on I-STRUCT-5]. The key insight: the crystallized vacuum has **two independent energy channels** — interface (dark energy, 137 generators) and structure (matter, 63 generators). The 63 internal-structure generators are a SUBSET of the 137 interface generators, contributing to BOTH channels (dual-role). With the HS metric giving equal weight per contribution (Schur's lemma, same argument as I-STRUCT-5), the matter fraction is 63/200 = 0.315 (0.04 sigma from Planck). The mechanism does NOT introduce a new assumption beyond I-STRUCT-5 — it extends the same principle (HS democracy) from gauge couplings to vacuum energy.

## Key Findings

1. **Dual-channel vacuum energy** [DERIVATION]: The vacuum energy has two independent contributions per generator:
   - Channel 1 (Interface/dark energy): U(n_d) x U(n_c) = 137 generators. Cost of maintaining the observational interface.
   - Channel 2 (Structure/matter): su(n_d) + su(n_c-n_d) = su(4) + su(7) = 63 generators. Cost of maintaining internal crystal organization.
   - 63 generators are dual-role (contribute to BOTH channels), 74 are interface-only.
   - Total contributions: 74×1 + 63×2 = 200.

2. **Equipartition from HS metric** [DERIVATION]: The HS metric on End(V) gives ||E_ij||^2 = 1 for ALL generators (regardless of which block). Schur's lemma: HS metric is the unique SO(n_c)-invariant inner product. Same argument as I-STRUCT-5 (democratic gauge coupling, S224). Each contribution carries equal energy epsilon -> Omega_m = 63/200.

3. **No new assumption needed** [OBSERVATION]: The extension from "HS metric determines gauge coupling" (I-STRUCT-5) to "HS metric determines vacuum energy partition" uses the SAME principle. It is [A-PHYSICAL] but does not add to the irreducible assumption count.

4. **EQ-002/EQ-003 duality made precise** [DERIVATION]: Both follow from one principle: "Physical quantities = HS-metric-weighted mode counts." Alpha = 1/N_I from interface mode counting; Omega_m = N_internal/N_total from dual-channel partition.

5. **Killing form alternative fails** [ANALYSIS]: With Killing normalization (weight proportional to n), generators in su(7) get 7/4 more weight than su(4) generators, giving Omega_m ~ 0.42. Doesn't match Planck. Only democratic (HS) normalization works.

6. **Sensitivity analysis** [VERIFICATION]: The ratio r = epsilon_S/epsilon_I must be in [0.97, 1.04] for Planck 1-sigma. r = 1 (equipartition) is well within this band.

7. **Cross-check: 63 = su(8) = su(2*n_d)** [OBSERVATION]: su(4) + su(7) = 15 + 48 = 63 = dim(su(8)) is a number identity (not a Lie algebra isomorphism). Structural significance unclear.

## Open Questions

1. **"Why now" problem** (EXISTING, UNRESOLVED): Omega_m = 63/200 is static; actual Omega_m varies with z. Same as standard cosmological coincidence problem. EQ-002 does not resolve this.

2. **Physical mapping** (EXISTING, [A-PHYSICAL]): "Structure generators = matter" is motivated by internal organization -> rest mass, but not derived from axioms.

3. **74 interface-only generators** (NEW, LOW): What is the physical significance of the 74 generators that contribute ONLY to dark energy? They include: 2 traces, 56 Hom-block generators, and 16 additional from su(4) within End(R^{11}).

4. **63 = su(8) identity** (NEW, LOW): Is it coincidental that su(n_d) + su(n_c-n_d) = dim(su(2*n_d))? For general n_d, n_c: (n_d^2-1) + ((n_c-n_d)^2-1) = (2*n_d)^2-1 only for specific (n_d, n_c).

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-002 is now SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED: Omega_m = 63/200 derived from dual-channel equipartition with the HS metric. The mechanism reuses I-STRUCT-5 (no new assumption). The EQ-002/EQ-003 duality is made precise: both are instances of "physical quantities = HS-metric-weighted mode counts." The "why now" problem remains (standard cosmology issue, not framework-specific). The main remaining gap is the [A-PHYSICAL] identification of internal generators with matter — this is the same type of assumption as I-STRUCT-5 (coupling = metric) and may be irreducible.
