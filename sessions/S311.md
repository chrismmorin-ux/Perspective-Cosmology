## Outcome

The decomposition 42 = 21 + 14 + 6 + 1 arises from a natural CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCE using the exterior algebra of Im(O): R -> Im(O) -> Lambda^2(Im(O)) -> Lambda^2(Im(O))_C, with cumulative dimensions {1, 7, 21, 42} and successive ratios {Im_O, Im_H, dim_C} = {7, 3, 2} -- the Sylvester denominators in reverse Cayley-Dickson order. The sequence is UNIQUE because the exterior algebra of R^7 gives integer ratios ONLY at k=1,2 ({7,3}), then FORCES a switch to complexification (x2) at step 3. The layer sizes match the subalgebra chain so(4) subset G_2 subset SO(7), with coset dimensions equal to division algebra dimensions: SO(7)/G_2 = Im_O = 7, G_2/SO(4) = dim_O = 8. The cumulative-to-quotient ratio is exactly dim_C = 2.

## Key Findings

1. **Construction sequence R -> Im(O) -> Lambda^2(Im(O)) -> Lambda^2(Im(O))_C** [DERIVATION]: Cumulative dimensions {1, 7, 21, 42} with ratios {Im_O=7, Im_H=3, dim_C=2}. Steps: embed in imaginary octonions, take exterior square, complexify. Each step is a canonical mathematical operation invoking a different division algebra in reverse CD order.

2. **Exterior algebra forces the switch** [DERIVATION]: C(7,k)/C(7,k-1) = (8-k)/k is integer only at k=1,2 giving {7,3}. At k=3 ratio is 5/3 (non-integer), so the construction naturally exits the exterior algebra and switches to complexification. The sequence is UNIQUE.

3. **Subalgebra chain so(4) subset G_2 subset SO(7)** [DERIVATION]: The layer sizes {6, 14, 21} equal the FULL dimensions of the Lie algebras in this chain. Sum 1+6+14+21 = 42.

4. **Coset dimensions = division algebra dimensions** [THEOREM]: dim(SO(7)/G_2) = 7 = Im_O (imaginary octonions). dim(G_2/SO(4)) = 8 = dim_O (full octonions). The coset spaces are literally octonionic.

5. **Cumulative/Quotient = dim_C** [THEOREM]: The sum-of-chain (42) divided by the standard quotient decomposition of so(7) (= 6+8+7 = 21) equals dim_C = 2. The factor of 2 is the complexification step.

6. **Ratio-minus-one values are Cayley-Dickson** [THEOREM]: Im_O-1 = 6 = C(n_d,2) = dim(so(4)). Im_H-1 = 2 = dim_C. dim_C-1 = 1 = Im_C.

7. **Alternative orderings: 3/6 clean** [OBSERVATION]: Orderings {7,3,2}, {7,2,3}, {2,7,3} all give layers that are framework numbers. But only {7,3,2} has canonical operations (embed, Lambda^2, complexify) at every step.

8. **Weight distribution** [DERIVATION]: so(7) gets 1/2 = 1/dim_C of the budget. G_2 gets 1/3 = 1/Im_H. so(4) gets 1/7 = 1/Im_O. Anti-correlation: the simplest algebra (C, weight 1/2) funds the largest symmetry group (SO(7), 21 dim).

## Open Questions

1. **Physical meaning of the construction sequence**: R -> Im(O) -> Lambda^2(Im(O)) -> Lambda^2(Im(O))_C uses embed, pair, complexify. Does this correspond to a physical process? The reverse CD order (O first, then H, then C) is "top-down" -- starting from the most complex algebra and successively applying simpler operations.
2. **The "forced switch" at k=3**: The failure of C(7,3)/C(7,2) to be integer is purely arithmetic. But physically, this means the exterior algebra "runs out" of division algebra ratios after two steps. Is this connected to dim = 3+1 spacetime?
3. **G_2/SO(4) as a Wolf space**: The 8-dimensional quaternion-Kahler manifold G_2/SO(4) has dim = dim_O. This space parameterizes quaternionic subalgebras of O. Does it play a role in the framework?

## Key Context for Next Session

The graded decomposition 42 = 21+14+6+1 arises from the construction sequence R -> Im(O) -> Lambda^2(Im(O)) -> Lambda^2(Im(O))_C with ratios {7,3,2} = Sylvester denominators in reverse CD order. The sequence is UNIQUE (exterior algebra forces switch at k=3). Layer sizes = Lie algebra dims in chain so(4) subset G_2 subset SO(7). Coset dims = division algebra dims: SO(7)/G_2 = 7 = Im_O, G_2/SO(4) = 8 = dim_O. Cumulative/Quotient = dim_C = 2. 32/32 PASS.
