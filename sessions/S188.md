# Session 188 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: Phase 4B: Mass Formulas Audit
**Topic**: Formalization plan Phase 4 (Particle Physics)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S187 (Phase 4A: Alpha chain)
**Next**: Phase 4C (Mixing angles) or 4D (Collider phenomenology)

---

## Outcome

Completed Phase 4B — Mass Formulas Audit. Classified three major mass formula chains with full [A]/[I]/[D] assumption tags: m_p/m_e (12-step chain), Higgs mass (10-step chain with canonical selection among 4 paths), and quark mass hierarchy (7-step top chain + 6 sequential ratios). Also audited Koide formula (10-step lepton chain + quark extensions).

Key honest findings: The main terms in mass formulas (1836, 121/238, quark ratios) are largely [CONJECTURE] — discovered with target values known. The correction terms (4/111 for alpha, 11/72 for proton) follow a genuine Lie algebra channel pattern. The top Yukawa y_t = 120/121 is the strongest single quark mass result (145 ppm, reasonable physics). Koide Q = 2/3 is genuinely derived (algebraically forced).

## Key Findings

### 1. m_p/m_e Classification [COMPLETE]
- 12-step chain: 5 derived + 1 I-MATH + 2 A-STRUCTURAL + 2 A-PHYSICAL + 2 CONJECTURE
- **Critical gap**: Step 7 — main term 1836 = 12×153 is [CONJECTURE] (post-hoc)
- **Strength**: Correction 11/72 follows unified Lie algebra channel pattern (su(3)⊗u(3))
- **Risk**: HIGH for main term, MEDIUM for correction
- Added to: `framework/investigations/primes/correction_terms_unified.md`

### 2. Higgs Mass Canonical Selection [COMPLETE]
- **Path 1 (CANONICAL)**: m_H = v×121/238, 0.057% error, grade B+
- Path 2 (λ=125/968): archived as [CONJECTURE], HRS=3
- Path 3 (λ=1/O): archived as [CONJECTURE]
- Path 4 (CW mechanism): grade D+, active frontier
- 10-step chain: Key gap is Step 8 — ratio 121/238 = n_c²/(2×119) not derived from dynamics
- **Strength**: EW boson ratios form self-consistent system (m_H/m_Z = 11/8)
- Added to: `framework/investigations/constants/higgs_vev_derivation.md`

### 3. Top Quark + Quark Hierarchy [COMPLETE]
- Top: m_t = (v/√2)(120/121), 145 ppm, 7-step chain
- Key gap: Why correction = 1/n_c² specifically? Four interpretations but none derived
- Full hierarchy: 6 sequential ratios, each separate [CONJECTURE]
- Accuracies degrade: 145 ppm → 2.4% → 1.1% → 5.7% → 5.1% → 6.4%
- **Risk**: MEDIUM for top alone, HIGH for full hierarchy chain
- Added to: `registry/derivations_summary.md` section 1.19

### 4. Koide Formula Audit [COMPLETE]
- Q = 2/3: [DERIVATION] — algebraically forced, A² = dim(C) = 2
- θ = π×73/99: [CONJECTURE] — prime attractor selection (0.006%)
- M = v/784: [CONJECTURE] — no dynamics derivation (0.069%)
- Quark extensions (8 parameters): all [CONJECTURE] — discovered post-hoc
- **Grade**: B for lepton Koide, C- for quark extensions
- Added to: `framework/investigations/particles/koide_formula_connection.md`

## Phase 4B Summary

| Item | Status | Key Finding |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 4B.1: m_p/m_e | DONE | Main term [CONJECTURE], correction follows genuine pattern |
| 4B.2: Higgs mass | DONE | Path 1 canonical (B+), 3 alternatives archived |
| 4B.3: Top quark | DONE | Top y_t strong (145 ppm), lighter quarks HIGH RISK |
| 4B.4: Neutrino | DONE (S167) | Already documented with 5 locked predictions |

**Phase 4B: COMPLETE.**

## Open Questions

1. Can y_t = 1 - 1/n_c² be derived from Yukawa coupling dynamics?
2. Can 1836 = 12×153 be derived from lattice QCD with framework inputs?
3. Can the Koide scale M = v/784 be derived from electroweak dynamics?
4. Why do lighter quark mass ratios use different framework numbers than heavier ones?

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 4B is complete. The mass formula landscape is now honestly classified. Next priorities from Phase 4 are:
- **4C: Mixing angles** (CKM search documentation, Weinberg angle definitive doc, theta_QCD fix)
- **4D: Collider phenomenology** (EWSB mechanism, beta function separation, CW potential status)

The pattern across all mass formulas: correction terms (sub-leading) are more defensible than main terms. The unified Lie algebra channel pattern (modes/channels) for corrections is the framework's strongest mass-related structural result.

*Session 188 complete. Phase 4B done. Next: Phase 4C (mixing angles) or 4D (collider).*
