# Session 170 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Phase 5.2 — Honest Statistical Significance (updated through S168)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S143 (stale, superseded)

---

## Outcome

Completed Phase 5.2 of the CMB Physics Plan. The critical new addition is a Monte Carlo null model testing whether the framework's building blocks {1,2,3,4,7,8,11} are special. Result: they are NOT special at percent-level precision (20th percentile at 1%, 51st at 0.1%). Random 7-element subsets of {1,...,20} match physics constants equally well.

The framework's real evidence comes from: (a) blind predictions with no look-elsewhere (P ~ 2.5e-7), (b) structural/qualitative predictions (gauge groups, spacetime dimensions), and (c) sub-ppm matches (but these were mostly searched, not derived).

## Key Findings

1. **[F1] Building blocks NOT special** [DERIVATION]: Monte Carlo with 5,000 random 7-element subsets of {1,...,20} shows framework at 20th percentile (1% precision) and 51st percentile (0.1% precision). Any small integer set achieves comparable matching. (20/20 PASS)

2. **[F2] Updated prediction inventory** [DERIVATION]: 35 numerical predictions (4 searched, 22 derived, 9 blind) + 11 structural. After independence analysis: 18 independent (4 searched, 8 derived, 6 blind).

3. **[F3] Blind predictions are strongest evidence** [DERIVATION]: P_blind ~ 2.5e-7 with no look-elsewhere effect. 6/7 CMB within 1 sigma, R_31=33 within 0.62 sigma. This is the one piece of evidence that cannot be attributed to post-hoc fitting.

4. **[F4] Honest P-value range** [DERIVATION]: 10^-8 (maximum prosecution) to 10^-7 (blind only). The naive 10^-42 is INVALID. The Monte Carlo-based P-value is ~0.5 (no evidence from building blocks alone).

5. **[F5] Bayesian update from Monte Carlo is ZERO** [DERIVATION]: The Monte Carlo P-value (~0.5) provides no Bayesian update regardless of prior. All evidence comes from blind predictions and trial-corrected analysis.

## Open Questions

1. **Sub-ppm Monte Carlo**: The current MC tests at 1% and 0.1% but not at 10 ppm. A sub-ppm MC would require more complex formula structures (cyclotomic polynomials, deeper products). Would the framework be special at that level?

2. **Formula structure specialness**: The MC tests building blocks but not formula STRUCTURES. Is the framework's formula structure (e.g., n + Phi_6(n_c)/int) more constrained than random formula structures?

3. **Cross-prediction correlation**: The framework uses the SAME intermediate quantities across predictions (e.g., Phi_6(11)=111 in both alpha and theta_W). Does this structural coherence have a measurable signature vs random frameworks?

4. **Structural prediction P-value**: Is there a meaningful way to assign probabilities to qualitative predictions like "SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)"?

## Key Context for Continuation

S170 completed Phase 5.2 with a sobering Monte Carlo result: building blocks are NOT special at percent-level. The framework's case rests on: (a) blind predictions (P~2.5e-7), (b) structural predictions, and (c) sub-ppm matches (but post-hoc). The honest P-value range is 10^-8 to 10^-7. Phase 5.2 is now DONE — deliverables written to `framework/STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS_HONEST.md`. Next: Phase 5.3 (independent verification), Phase 5.4 (literature comparison), or Phase 6 (documentation), or return to physics (CW calculation, full SM group, neutrino continuation).
