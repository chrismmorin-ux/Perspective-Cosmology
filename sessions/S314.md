# Session S314: EQ-013 Dark Matter Mass Formula Selection

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: EQ-013 — Dark matter mass formula selection (3 competing formulas)
**Topic**: Dark matter / cosmology
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S242 (DM mass discrepancy investigation)

---

## Outcome

All three investigations complete. Formula C (m_e * (n_c-1)^n_d = 5.11 GeV) selected as PRIMARY based on strongest derivation chain (weakness score 0: 1 import, 1 conjecture, strong geometry). Formula A demoted to SECONDARY (weakness 5: 2 imports, 2 conjectures, weak geometry). Formula B remains QUARANTINED. The 0.03% A/C agreement is proven coincidental (317 ppm gap, prime numerator 2053). LZ (Dec 2025) does NOT exclude 5.1 GeV — cross-section dependent, not mass-only. EQ-013 SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED.

## Key Findings

1. **I1: A and C are structurally distinct** [THEOREM by computation]: The identity A=C requires m_p/m_e = 90000/49 = 1836.7347. Framework predicts m_p/m_e = 132203/72 = 1836.1528 (tree). Gap = 2053/3528 = 0.582, or 317 ppm. Numerator 2053 is prime — no framework decomposition. The corrections differ algebraically: identity needs 36/49 = n_d*Im_H^2/Im_O^2, framework gives 11/72 = n_c/(dim_O*Im_H^2). **The 0.03% mass agreement is a numerical coincidence.** 12/12 PASS.

2. **I2: Formula C has strongest derivation chain** [DERIVATION assessment]:
   - **C** (m_e*(n_c-1)^n_d): 1 import (m_e), 1 conjecture (exponent=n_d), geometry 3/3 (SO(11)->SO(10), H=3+1). Weakness score: **0**.
   - **A** (m_p*49/9): 2 imports (m_p, asymmetric DM), 2 conjectures (ratio, mass mapping), geometry 1/3. Weakness score: **5**.
   - **B** (m_e*121/4): 1 import, 3 conjectures, geometry 0/3. Weakness score: **7**. QUARANTINE.

3. **Formula A does NOT connect to Omega_m = 63/200** [THEOREM]: If Omega_DM/Omega_b = 49/9 and Omega_m = 63/200, the implied "baryonic share" of 63 generators is 9.776 — NOT an integer. The sum 49+9=58=2*29 has non-framework prime factor 29. The 63/200 derivation (End(R^11) generator counting) and 49/9 (Im_O^2/Im_H^2) are structurally independent. No clean connection found.

4. **Omega consistency**: With both assumptions, Omega_b = 567/11600 = 0.04888 (0.85% from measured 0.0493), Omega_DM = 3087/11600 = 0.2661 (0.42% from measured 0.265). Numerator 567 = Im_O * Im_H^4 (framework), but denominator 11600 has factor 29 (not framework). Good numerical agreement does not constitute structural derivation.

5. **I3: LZ does NOT exclude 5.1 GeV** [EXPERIMENTAL]: LZ (arXiv:2512.08065, Dec 2025) searched 3-9 GeV with 5.7 tonne-year. At 5 GeV: sigma_SI < ~10^-44 to 10^-43 cm^2. Simple Higgs portal ADM models (sigma ~ 10^-41): EXCLUDED. Light mediator (sigma ~ 10^-44): BEING PROBED. Composite/hidden sector (sigma ~ 10^-46): STILL VIABLE. Framework does not predict sigma_SI, so mass prediction is NOT falsified. Full falsification requires neutrino floor at 5 GeV (~10^-48 cm^2).

6. **(n_c-1)^n_d interpretation** [CONJECTURE]: If the exponent in Formula C is n_d = dim(H) = 4, then m_DM = m_e * (n_c-1)^n_d uses BOTH fundamental framework dimensions with no free parameters. Structural motivation: each spacetime dimension contributes a factor of (n_c-1) mixing suppression. Not yet derived from axioms.

## Open Questions

1. **Derive exponent = n_d** (EQ-013 remaining gap): Can (n_c-1)^n_d be derived from axioms? Structural motivation exists (mixing suppression per spacetime dim) but no proof. If proven, Formula C becomes [DERIVATION].
2. **Sigma_SI prediction**: Framework needs DM-nucleon cross-section to become testable by LZ/XENONnT. Requires interaction mechanism from compositeness scale.
3. **Formula A retirement?**: With Formula C selected as primary and no structural connection to Omega_m=63/200, should Formula A be formally downgraded to [SPECULATION]?

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-013 is SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED. Formula C (m_DM = m_e * (n_c-1)^n_d = 5.11 GeV) selected as primary DM mass prediction. The only remaining gap is deriving the exponent n_d from framework axioms. The A/C near-agreement (0.03%) is a proven coincidence — each formula must stand alone. LZ's null result at 5 GeV is model-dependent and does not falsify the mass prediction. The framework's next step for DM physics is either (a) derive the exponent or (b) predict the DM-nucleon cross-section.
