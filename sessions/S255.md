# Session 255: CCP + Pipeline Framework Integration (Priority 4+5)

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Focus**: Propagate S251 foundational results through publications (P4) and topic files (P5)
**Previous**: S254 (Priority 3 -- 11 files)
**Status**: COMPLETE (Priorities 4+5, CCP propagation project COMPLETE)

---

## Outcome

Systematic propagation of AXM_0120 (CCP) across all Priority 4 publication files and Priority 5 topic files. Assumption count updated from "~3" to "~2" across all 5 main publications (F=C no longer counted as structural assumption). Pipeline gauge route and Im(H) tensor generation derivation added to TECHNICAL_SUMMARY and THESIS. PHYSICIST_SUMMARY flagged as significantly outdated with CCP corrections. Topic files confirmed clean (no CCP-resolvable tags). CLAUDE.md example updated.

**CCP propagation project summary (S252-S255)**: 40 files updated total across 4 sessions.

---

## Key Findings

1. **[PROPAGATION] 7 files updated**. HONEST_ASSESSMENT, TECHNICAL_SUMMARY, THESIS, OBJECTIONS_AND_RESPONSES, PLAIN_LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION (all assumption count + derivation updates), plus PHYSICIST_SUMMARY (outdated warning + CCP fixes) and CLAUDE.md (example fix).

2. **[UPDATE] Assumption count ~3 -> ~2 across all publications**. F=C was one of the ~3 structural assumptions cited in every publication. With CCP deriving it (S251), the count drops to ~2 (emergent gauge coupling [A-PHYSICAL], crystallization interpretation). Updated consistently in HONEST_ASSESSMENT, TECHNICAL_SUMMARY, THESIS, OBJECTIONS_AND_RESPONSES, PLAIN_LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION.

3. **[UPDATE] Pipeline gauge route added to TECHNICAL_SUMMARY and THESIS**. Section 4.1 renamed "Two Routes to the Gauge Group" with both automorphism (Route 1) and Pipeline 121->55->18->12 (Route 2) documented.

4. **[UPDATE] Generation derivation updated**. "3 generations from Im(H) = 3" -> "Im(H) tensor decomposition: 7->3+3-bar+1, content per gen = 7 = dim(Im(O))" across HONEST_ASSESSMENT, TECHNICAL_SUMMARY, THESIS.

5. **[FIX] HONEST_ASSESSMENT Einstein eq row**. Removed stale "(but CC sign wrong)" caveat (already resolved S230 but missed in this table row).

6. **[FLAG] PHYSICIST_SUMMARY.md severely outdated**. Pre-S120 document with multiple errors (sin^2=2/9 falsified, "11 from M-theory", "no QM derived", "groups imported"). Added prominent WARNING block with corrections. Needs full rewrite in a separate session.

7. **[CLEAN] Topic files have no CCP-resolvable tags**. Grep confirmed: no [A-STRUCTURAL], [A-IMPORT], or "imported from" language for n_c/n_d/F=C in any topic file. These files use framework quantities naturally without formal import tagging.

8. **[FIX] CLAUDE.md example updated**. [A-STRUCTURAL] example changed from "F = C" (now derived) to "linear coupling form" (genuinely structural).

## Files Modified (7 total)

### Publications (6 files)
| File | Key Changes |
|------|-------------|
| `publications/HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md` | Assumption ~3->~2. "Derived combinations" -> "Derived quantities [D: CCP]". Pipeline gauge + Im(H) tensor generation. Einstein eq CC caveat removed. CCP/Pipeline/generation added to Key Derivation Advances table. |
| `publications/TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md` | Assumption ~3->~2. n_c/n_d table: added F=C row, [D: CCP] tags. Section 4.1 -> "Two Routes to Gauge Group" with Pipeline. Generation 7->3+3-bar+1. Key dependencies tree updated. |
| `publications/THESIS.md` | Assumption ~3->~2. Framework numbers block: [D: CCP] + F=C line. Pipeline gauge route. Generation Im(H) tensor. Caveat updated (F=C derived). |
| `publications/OBJECTIONS_AND_RESPONSES.md` | Objection 3: F=C no longer example of structural assumption. Three mentions of "~3 structural" -> "~2 structural". Summary table updated. |
| `publications/PLAIN_LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION.md` | "~3 structural assumptions" -> "~2". F=C derived note added. |
| `publications/PHYSICIST_SUMMARY.md` | WARNING block added (outdated document). "n_total=11 (M-theory)" -> "[D: CCP]". Open questions #1, #4 marked RESOLVED. |

### Root (1 file)
| File | Key Changes |
|------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | [A-STRUCTURAL] example: "F = C" -> "linear coupling form" |

## Scripts

No new verification scripts this session (propagation-only work; no new calculations).

---

## Open Questions

1. **PHYSICIST_SUMMARY.md needs full rewrite**. Pre-S120 document with many stale claims. Low priority but should be done before any external sharing.
2. **CCP propagation COMPLETE**. No remaining files with CCP-resolvable [A-STRUCTURAL]/[A-IMPORT] tags identified.
3. **Remaining irreducible assumptions**: (1) [A-COUPLING] gauge coupling scaling, (2) [A-PHYSICAL] identifications (interface=1/alpha, generations=Im(H)), (3) linear coupling form [A-STRUCTURAL], (4) |Pi| unconstrained, (5) democratic counting [A-STRUCTURAL].

## CCP Propagation Project Summary (S252-S255)

| Session | Priority | Files | Key Updates |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| S252 | P1: Core derivation chains | 13 | Axiom files, definitions, core derivation chains. Alpha chain 3+1->1+1 assumptions. |
| S253 | P2: Alpha + core theorems + layers | 9 | Alpha investigations (5), core theorems (1), layer files (3). Independence assumption kept. |
| S254 | P3: Investigation files | 11 | Dark matter (2), spacetime (2), cosmology (2), quantum (1), constants (1), meta (1), alpha (2). 6 "derive dimensions" RESOLVED. |
| S255 | P4+P5: Publications + topics | 7 | Publications (6), CLAUDE.md (1). Assumption count ~3->~2. Topic files clean. |
| **Total** | | **40** | All CCP-resolvable tags upgraded framework-wide. |

## Key Context for Next Session

CCP propagation project is COMPLETE (40 files across 4 sessions). The framework now consistently shows n_c=11, n_d=4, F=C as [DERIVED from CCP (AXM_0120)] everywhere. Assumption count is ~2 across all publications. The remaining irreducible assumptions are [A-COUPLING], [A-PHYSICAL] identifications, linear coupling form, |Pi| unconstrained, and democratic counting. PHYSICIST_SUMMARY needs a full rewrite but is low priority. The next natural directions are: physics investigations from the exploration queue (EQ-002 Om_m, EQ-003 alpha Step 5, EQ-006 top Yukawa), or quality/maintenance work.
