# Session 184 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Fourth-power primes: CR-061 resolution + AXM_0118 generalization
**Topic**: Prime theory / AXM_0118
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S181 (G-004 resolution), S182 (Phase 1-2 algebraic structure)

---

## Outcome

CR-061 PARTIALLY RESOLVED. The central discovery: **a⁴ + b⁴ is a cyclotomic norm form** — specifically N_{Q(ζ₈)/Q}(a + bζ₈). This is the exact quartic analogue of a² + b² = N_{Q(i)/Q}(a + bi). The sum-of-squares framework primes (Level 1) and fourth-power primes (Level 2) are two instances of the same mathematical structure: cyclotomic norm forms evaluated at framework dimension inputs.

This resolves why 97 appears in Tier 1 claims: 97 = 2⁴ + 3⁴ = N(2 + 3ζ₈) uses DIRECT framework dimensions dim(C) = 2, Im_H = 3, not derived dimensions.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: The Norm Form Identity [PROVEN — I-MATH]

**Confidence**: [THEOREM]

```
N_{Q(ζ₈)/Q}(a + bζ₈) = (a + bζ₈)(a + bζ₈³)(a + bζ₈⁵)(a + bζ₈⁷) = a⁴ + b⁴
```

Verified by SymPy MCP (symbolic) and by script (numerical, all framework pairs). This is a standard result in algebraic number theory (cyclotomic norm theory).

Key mathematical facts:
- Φ₈(x) = x⁴ + 1 is the 8th cyclotomic polynomial
- [Q(ζ₈) : Q] = φ(8) = 4 = dim(H)
- Z[ζ₈] has class number 1 (PID/UFD)
- Gal(Q(ζ₈)/Q) ≅ Z/2 × Z/2 (Klein four-group)

### Finding 2: The Two-Level Hierarchy [DERIVATION]

**Confidence**: [DERIVATION]

| Level | Ring | Norm Form | # Primes from D_fw | Prime condition |
|-------|------|-----------|--------------------|-|
| 1 | Z[i] = Z[ζ₄] | a² + b² | 8 | p ≡ 1 mod 4 (iff) |
| 2 | Z[ζ₈] | a⁴ + b⁴ | 10 | p ≡ 1 mod 16 (necessary, not sufficient) |
| Unified | — | — | 16 | — |

Only n = 4 and n = 8 cyclotomic norms give **pure power sums** (no cross-terms). Other cyclotomic norms (n = 3, 5, 7, 12, ...) have cross-terms.

### Finding 3: The 97 Resolution [DERIVATION]

**Confidence**: [DERIVATION]

97 has two representations:
- 97 = 4² + 9² (sum-of-squares; uses 9 ∉ D_framework — THIS was the CR-061 problem)
- 97 = 2⁴ + 3⁴ (fourth-power; uses 2, 3 ∈ D_framework — RESOLVED)

The identity 2⁴ = 4² and 3⁴ = 9² means the SAME numerical values (16 + 81 = 97) serve both, but the fourth-power representation is more fundamental because it uses direct framework dimensions.

### Finding 4: The Associative Pattern [CONJECTURE]

**Confidence**: [CONJECTURE]

The consecutive primes n⁴ + (n+1)⁴ for n = 1, 2, 3 produce 17, 97, 337, using exactly {1, 2, 3, 4} = the associative algebra dimensions. The pattern:

- Pure associative (a, b ∈ {1,2,3,4}): 5 primes — ALL work
- Bridge (one from {1,2,3,4}, one from {7,8}): 3 primes — ALL work
- Pure non-associative ({7,8} only): 0 primes — ALL FAIL (6497 = 73×89)
- Crystal bridge (involving 11): 2 primes

Associativity appears necessary for at least one input to get a fourth-power prime from D_framework.

### Finding 5: Key Mathematical Context [LITERATURE]

From comprehensive web research:

**Proven results**:
- Every odd quartan prime p ≡ 1 mod 16 [elementary congruence]
- x⁴ + 1 is irreducible over Q but reducible mod EVERY prime [Gal group has no order-4 element]
- Z[ζ₈] has class number 1 [standard]
- Friedlander-Iwaniec (1998): ∞ many primes a² + b⁴ [proven, but broader class]
- Green-Sawhney (2024): ∞ many primes p² + 4q² with p, q prime [breakthrough]
- g(4) = 19 (Waring) [Balasubramanian-Deshouillers-Dress, 1986]

**Open problems**:
- Whether ∞ many primes a⁴ + b⁴ exist (conjectured, unproven)
- No simple characterization of which primes p ≡ 1 mod 16 are quartan primes
- Bateman-Horn conjecture (predicts density, unproven)

**No known connection**: dim(H) = 4 and fourth-power primality. The shared "4" is coincidental in current mathematics (Cayley-Dickson doubling vs Euler totient vs field degree).

## Open Questions

1. **Formal generalization of AXM_0118**: Should it explicitly include Level 2 (a⁴+b⁴)? Or define a general "cyclotomic norm form" principle for n ∈ {4, 8}?
2. **Physical predictions from unmapped Level 2 primes**: 257, 2417, 2657, 4177, 14657, 14897 — do any predict new constants?
3. **Why n = 4 and n = 8 only?** Why not n = 3 (Eisenstein), n = 5, or higher cyclotomic norms? Is this tied to the division algebra structure?
4. **The associative pattern**: Why do pure non-associative fourth-power sums always produce composites from D_framework? Is this a theorem or a pattern from small numbers?
5. **Connection between [Q(ζ₈):Q] = 4 and dim(H) = 4**: No known causal link. Can one be established?

## Key Context for Next Session

The norm form identity a⁴ + b⁴ = N_{Q(ζ₈)/Q}(a + bζ₈) is the central result. It places the fourth-power primes on the same algebraic footing as the sum-of-squares primes. The unified catalog has 16 primes instead of 8. The remaining question is whether to formally revise AXM_0118 to a "cyclotomic norm form" axiom, or keep Level 2 as a derived consequence. The physical predictions from unmapped Level 2 primes (especially 257, 2417, 2657, 4177) could strengthen or weaken the case.
