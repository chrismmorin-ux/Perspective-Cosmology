# Session 227: Crystallization Catalog Expansion -- Phase 3 Bound States

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog Phase 3: bound state sub-catalogs and hadron mass verification
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S225 (Phase 2 scattering processes)

## Outcome

Phase 3 of the Crystallization Catalog expansion is complete. Two bound state sub-catalog files created: `hadron_formation.md` (6 processes: pion, kaon, proton/neutron, Delta baryons, J/psi, Upsilon) and `nuclear_binding.md` (4 processes: deuteron, helium-4, iron-56, magic numbers). One new verification script `hadron_mass_crystallization.py` (16/16 PASS) verifying m_p/m_e = 1836 + 11/72 (0.06 ppm), sqrt(sigma) = 8*m_p/17 (0.4%), N_c color singlet structure, color factors, and SEMF channel decomposition. C12 and C13 fleshed out from skeletons to full entries with observables tables and sub-catalog references. Catalog updated v3.2 -> v3.3 (55 scripts, 679 tests).

## Key Findings

1. **Hadron formation: 4/6 [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED]** [DERIVATION for N_c]: Pion (N_c in pi0->gg anomaly), proton/neutron (N_c = 3 quarks per baryon + m_p/m_e prediction), J/psi and Upsilon (N_c in Cornell potential C_F = 4/3). Kaon and Delta are [STANDARD-RELABELED]. All framework content traces to single derived quantity N_c = Im_H = 3.

2. **Nuclear binding: 4/4 [STANDARD-RELABELED]** [honest assessment]: Framework provides channel labels only (O-channel volume, C-channel Coulomb, H-channel asymmetry) for the Bethe-Weizsacker mass formula. No binding energies derived. Magic number coincidences (2 = dim C, 8 = dim O, 28 = n_d*Im_O) are [SPECULATION] — 3/7 match is not impressive, and no derivation mechanism exists.

3. **m_p/m_e = 12*153 + 11/72 verified** [CONJECTURE, Tier 1]: 0.0568 ppm match. Decomposition: 12 = dim(SM gauge group), 153 = Im_H^2 * 17, 11/72 = n_c/(O*Im_H^2). The correction term factorization is new to this script.

4. **String tension sqrt(sigma) = 8*m_p/17 verified** [CONJECTURE, HRS=6]: 441.5 MeV vs 440(20) conventional, 0.4% error. Within 0.5 sigma of Knechtli (2024) value 445(7) MeV. Constituent quark chain: Im_H * 17/(O*Im_H) = 17/O = 17/8.

5. **SEMF channel decomposition** [STANDARD-RELABELED]: All semi-empirical mass formula coefficients mapped to channels. Cross-check for Fe-56: 0.6% error (expected for SEMF approximation). Framework adds labels, not values.

## Open Questions

1. **Hadron mass spectrum** (EQ-related): No hadron masses are derived from first principles. m_p/m_e = 12*153 + 11/72 is pattern-matched, not axiomatically derived. The factor 12 and correction 11/72 need derivation chains.
2. **String tension derivation**: sqrt(sigma) = 8*m_p/17 is a conjecture (HRS=6). The constituent quark chain (17/24 ratio) is structurally interesting but not a first-principles derivation.
3. **Magic number mechanism**: 2, 8, 28 coincide with division algebra dimensions, but 20, 50, 82, 126 do not. Without a derivation mechanism connecting division algebras to nuclear shell closures, this remains [SPECULATION].
4. **Phase 4 ready**: Phase transitions (QCD phase diagram, EWSB, BBN) are next. These may have more framework content than nuclear binding (especially EWSB with xi = 4/121).

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 3 bound states complete. The `bound_states/` subdirectory now has 2 files with 10 process entries covering hadron formation and nuclear binding. The sub-catalog system now totals 6 files, 28 process entries, and 4 dedicated verification scripts (63/63 PASS). Catalog v3.3 (55 scripts, 679 tests). Hadron physics is dominated by N_c = Im_H = 3 — the single derived quantity that enters color singlet formation, color factors, anomaly coefficients, and mode counting. Nuclear binding is the framework's weakest area: all content is channel relabeling or speculative magic number coincidences.

**Recommended next**: Phase 4 (phase transitions — QCD phase diagram, EWSB, BBN) or return to physics investigations (EQ-003 coset geometry, EQ-007 democratic counting mechanism).
