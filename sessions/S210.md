# Session 210: EWSB Testable Predictions

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Collider-crystallization — coupling deviations, colored pNGB bounds, oblique parameters, single doublet
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S180 (lambda_0 = 1/O from CW), S195 (coset correction, 24 colored pNGBs)

## Outcome

Extracted 6 concrete testable predictions from the composite Higgs / EWSB mechanism. Computed all Higgs coupling modifications from xi = n_d/n_c^2 = 4/121 with full SymPy verification. Honestly documented the colored pNGB mass tension (crude 151 GeV vs LHC 1.5 TeV bounds) and showed resolution paths. Registered 4 new falsification entries (F-COL-1 through F-COL-4). Total: 4 new scripts, 56/56 tests PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **[CONJECTURE] kappa_V = sqrt(117/121) = 0.9833** — 1.67% below SM. Within current LHC (1.00 +/- 0.04). HL-LHC marginal (1.1 sigma), FCC-ee decisive (5.6 sigma). Derivation chain: xi = n_d/n_c^2 [CONJECTURE] + standard pNGB formula [I-MATH].

2. **[CONJECTURE] kappa_f(MCHM5) = 113/(11*sqrt(117)) = 0.9497** — 5.03% below SM. Testable at HL-LHC (2.0 sigma). Depends on fermion embedding (MCHM4 vs MCHM5 not yet determined by framework).

3. **[DERIVATION] Single Higgs doublet from AXM_0109** — Real tilt matrix gives 4 real DOF = 1 complex doublet. Excludes 2HDM (all 4 types), MSSM, NMSSM, Georgi-Machacek, Type-II seesaw. Consistent with LHC (no H+/-, H, A found).

4. **[CONJECTURE] Colored pNGB mass tension** — Crude CW estimate ~151 GeV is 10x below LHC bound (~1.5 TeV). Enhanced with log factor: ~590 GeV. Multi-site model (N_CW ~ 8): ~1.7 TeV, above bound. S parameter independently excludes light limit (2.8 sigma). Tension is GENERIC to all composite Higgs models — not a framework-specific problem.

5. **[CONJECTURE] S parameter constraint** — Delta_S(light) = 1/pi = 0.318, excluded at 2.8 sigma. For m > 1 TeV: decouples. T parameter negligible for degenerate doublets. Higgs compositeness Delta_S ~ 0.009 (negligible at xi = 0.033).

6. **Falsification entries registered** — F-COL-1 (kappa_V), F-COL-2 (single doublet), F-COL-3 (colored pNGBs), F-COL-4 (f ~ 1354 GeV). Total active predictions: 40 → 44.

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Fermion embedding**: MCHM4 vs MCHM5 — framework should determine this from SO(11) representation theory. Would resolve the kappa_f ambiguity.
2. **Derive xi from dynamics**: xi = n_d/n_c^2 is conjectured, not derived from vacuum alignment. Need crystallization dynamics at EW scale.
3. **Colored pNGB mass from first principles**: Beyond parametric estimates, need actual CW calculation with specific composite sector Lagrangian.
4. **Top Yukawa from SO(11)**: y_t = sqrt(2)*m_t/v works empirically; need partial compositeness embedding.
5. **Triple Higgs coupling**: kappa_lambda = 0.950 is testable at FCC-hh (5-10% precision). HL-LHC ~50% precision is insufficient.

## Key Context for Next Session

The EWSB sector now has concrete, testable predictions registered. The main tension (colored pNGB masses) is honestly documented and mirrors the standard composite Higgs "little hierarchy problem." The framework's unique prediction is the SINGLE doublet (from AXM_0109), which is structural and independent of mass estimates. All predictions are in the 2-5% deviation range from SM — right at the edge of current precision, with HL-LHC and FCC as decisive tests.

Next natural steps: (a) resolve fermion embedding to fix kappa_f, (b) derive xi from dynamics, or (c) move to a different physics topic.
