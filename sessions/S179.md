# Session 179 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Coleman-Weinberg potential for Higgs mass from pNGB framework
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S175 (EWSB: Higgs = pNGB doublet from epsilon_di)
**Next**: Derive lambda_0 = 1/O from CW, top Yukawa from SO(11) fermion embedding

---

## Outcome

Computed the pNGB Higgs Coleman-Weinberg potential in the SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) coset framework. Gauge loops produce sin^4(h/f) only — cannot trigger EWSB alone. Top Yukawa dominates (gauge is 0.9% of top contribution). Found a conjectural Higgs quartic formula lambda_H = 125/968 = (n_c^2 + n_d)/(O * n_c^2) that matches the measured value to 0.2% (m_H = 125.13 GeV, 0.72 sigma). The formula decomposes as (1/O)(1 + n_d/n_c^2), suggesting composite Higgs with f ~ 1.35 TeV. Emerged from search of ~20 formulas — look-elsewhere effect is ~8%, so this is a conjecture (HRS=3), not a derivation.

## Key Findings

### F1 [DERIVATION]: Gauge loops give sin^4(h/f) only
Gauge boson loops in the pNGB potential produce ONLY the beta (sin^4) term, not the alpha (sin^2) term. This means gauge loops alone cannot trigger EWSB — the top Yukawa is required. Standard composite Higgs result, confirmed in our SO(11) context.

### F2 [DERIVATION]: Gauge contribution is negligible
beta_gauge / beta_top = 0.0094 (0.9%). The gauge contribution to the quartic is negligible compared to the top Yukawa. This justifies the approximation lambda_H ~ (N_c y_t^4)/(16 pi^2) * c_beta.

### F3 [CONJECTURE]: lambda_H ~ 1/O = 1/8 (leading order)
The measured lambda_H = 0.1294 is close to 1/dim(O) = 0.125 (3.4% match). This is the leading-order approximation. Physical interpretation: O = 8 appears as the octonionic normalization of the composite sector.

### F4 [CONJECTURE, HRS=3]: lambda_H = 125/968 (0.2% match)
The corrected formula:
```
lambda_H = (n_c^2 + n_d) / (O * n_c^2) = 125/968 = 0.12913
```
Gives m_H = v * 5*sqrt(5)/22 = 125.13 GeV (measured: 125.25 +/- 0.17, error = 0.72 sigma = 973 ppm).

**Look-elsewhere**: ~20 formulas tested, P_adjusted ~ 8%. Could be numerological.

### F5 [DERIVATION]: Structural identity n_c^2 + n_d = N_I - n_d(n_d-1) = 125
This is an algebraic identity:
```
N_I - n_d(n_d-1) = (n_d^2 + n_c^2) - n_d^2 + n_d = n_c^2 + n_d   QED
```
The coincidence n_d(n_d-1) = 12 = dim(SM gauge group) depends on specific division algebra dimensions, not algebraic necessity.

### F6 [CONJECTURE]: xi = n_d/n_c^2 = 4/121, f ~ 1.35 TeV
The misalignment parameter xi = v^2/f^2 = n_d/n_c^2 = 4/121 = 0.033 gives:
- Compositeness scale f = v * n_c/2 = 1354 GeV ~ 1.35 TeV
- Safe from precision EW constraints (xi < 0.2)
- Colored pNGB masses ~151 GeV (crude one-loop estimate, potential LHC tension)

## Open Questions

1. **Derive lambda_0 = 1/O from CW potential**: Why is the leading quartic 1/dim(O)? Need to show this from the Coleman-Weinberg calculation with specific form factors in the SO(11) coset.

2. **Derive xi = n_d/n_c^2 from crystallization dynamics**: The misalignment parameter is currently conjectural. Need physical mechanism for vacuum alignment angle.

3. **Top Yukawa from SO(11) fermion embedding**: The m_H prediction needs y_t ~ 1. Need to derive this from the fermion representation in the SO(11) framework.

4. **Colored pNGB phenomenology**: Crude estimate gives ~151 GeV — likely below LHC exclusion bounds. Need careful calculation with all contributions, or explain why colored pNGBs are heavier.

5. **Formalize or falsify lambda_H = 125/968**: This emerged from formula search (HRS=3). Need either a derivation from CW or recognition that it's numerological.

## Key Context for Next Session

The pNGB Higgs CW potential has a standard composite Higgs form V(h) = -alpha f^4 sin^2(h/f) + beta f^4 sin^4(h/f). Gauge loops give beta only (no alpha), so EWSB requires top Yukawa (alpha comes from top). The conjectural formula lambda_H = 125/968 matches to 0.2% but emerged from search of ~20 formulas — not derived. The decomposition lambda = (1/O)(1 + n_d/n_c^2) has a natural composite Higgs interpretation: 1/O is the leading quartic, n_d/n_c^2 is the misalignment correction. The compositeness scale f ~ 1.35 TeV is experimentally viable. To strengthen this from conjecture to derivation, need to show WHY lambda_0 = 1/O from the CW potential form factors and WHY xi = n_d/n_c^2 from the vacuum alignment dynamics.
