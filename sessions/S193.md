# Session 193 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: n_c = 11 derivation strengthening + MUH improvements
**Topic**: Crystal dimension, division algebras, Tegmark's MUH
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S192 (Phase 5 cosmology audit), S189 (Phase 4C mixing angles)
**Next**: Phase 6 (Gravity Assessment) or further n_c = 11 gap closure

---

## Outcome

Strengthened the n_c = 11 derivation from three directions. (1) Proved THM_04AB (Automorphism Independence): G_2 irreducibility forces Im(C), Im(H), Im(O) onto orthogonal subspaces, giving n_c >= 1+3+7 = 11. Computationally verified dim(g_2) = 14 and G_2 does NOT preserve Im(H). (2) Replaced vague "algebraic completeness" conjecture with specific Cayley-Dickson Closure Principle — narrower gap, unique operation, natural termination at sedenions. (3) Found 9 independent convergence points with Furey-Hughes (2022) division algebraic symmetry breaking cascade. Also formalized Perspective as rigorous replacement for Tegmark's circular SAS definition.

## Key Findings

1. **[THEOREM] THM_04AB: Automorphism Independence** — G_2 = Aut(O) acts irreducibly on Im(O) = R^7 (dim(g_2) = 14, verified computationally). This forces Im(H) and Im(O) onto orthogonal subspaces (any intersection would be a G_2-invariant proper subspace, contradicting irreducibility). Therefore n_c >= Im(C) + Im(H) + Im(O) = 1 + 3 + 7 = 11. With minimality: n_c = 11.

2. **[PRINCIPLE] Cayley-Dickson Closure** — If Crystal supports algebra A and CD(A) is a normed division algebra, Crystal supports CD(A). This replaces AXM_0115's vague "algebraic completeness" with a specific, unique operation. CD is parameter-free, terminates naturally (sedenions have zero divisors), and requires only ONE extension step (H -> O). Gap narrowed from [CONJECTURE] to [STRONG CONJECTURE / PRINCIPLE].

3. **[DERIVATION] Furey-Hughes Cross-Check** — 9 independent convergence points with arXiv:2210.10126: both start from R, C, H, O; both derive SM gauge group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) (dim=12); both use O for SU(3), H for SU(2), C for U(1); both have SU(2)xSU(2) intermediate; Spin(10) embeds in SO(11); breaking follows reverse CD order O->H->C. Different mechanisms (reflections vs crystallization), same algebraic content.

4. **[DERIVATION] Perspective = Rigorous SAS** — All 5 of Tegmark's SAS requirements mapped to framework equivalents: T1 (logical thought) -> transition algebra T=H; T2 (self-awareness) -> THM_04A7 self-model incompleteness; T3 (time perception) -> DERIVED from adjacency; T4 (predictability) -> H associativity; T5 (stability) -> crystallization tendency. Our definition avoids Tegmark's circular self-reference.

5. **[BUG] Fano Plane Orientation** — Three early scripts (g2_irreducibility_check.py, g2_irreducibility_v2.py, g2_rank_check.py) used wrong Fano triples, giving dim(g_2) = 6 instead of 14. Correct triples from Wikipedia: [(1,2,3), (1,4,5), (1,7,6), (2,4,6), (2,5,7), (3,4,7), (3,6,5)]. Key: triples (1,7,6) and (3,6,5) have reversed last two indices vs naive ordering. Fixed in g2_final.py.

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **CD Closure Principle -> Axiom?**: Can we derive CD Closure from Layer 0 axioms, or must it remain a principle? The gap is narrow (one unique operation) but not closed.
2. **Independence requirement**: The claim that automorphism groups act independently is [A-PHYSICAL] — can this be strengthened?
3. **Furey-Hughes deeper connection**: Both cascades driven by reverse CD order. Is there a common mathematical structure explaining why?
4. **Three generations**: Neither our framework nor Furey-Hughes has a fully rigorous derivation of exactly 3 generations. FH uses triality; we use prime structure [CONJECTURE].
5. **g2_final.py Moufang test**: The oct_mult helper doesn't handle full octonion products (only imaginary-part-to-imaginary-part). Fix to get 5/5 PASS, though G_2 results are unaffected.
6. **Phase 6 (Gravity)**: Einstein equations (1.17 in derivations_summary) tagged DERIVED but likely need downgrade similar to Phase 5.

## Key Context for Next Session

The n_c = 11 derivation is now significantly stronger than before this session. The full chain is: AXM_0100 (finiteness) + AXM_0119 (linearity) -> THM_0484 (T is division algebra) -> Frobenius (T in {R,C,H}) -> T=H [A-STRUCTURAL] -> CD(H)=O [I-MATH] -> CD Closure [PRINCIPLE] -> Hurwitz terminates at O -> THM_04AB (G_2 irreducibility forces orthogonality) -> n_c = 1+3+7 = 11. The remaining gap is localized to the CD Closure Principle (narrower than the previous "algebraic completeness" conjecture). External validation from Furey-Hughes (2022) provides 9 independent convergence points. The Perspective-as-SAS formalization positions the framework as a concrete, rigorous instantiation of Tegmark's MUH.
