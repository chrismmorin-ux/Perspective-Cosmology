# Session S328: U(1)_Y Embedding in SO(11)

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: U(1)_Y embedding in SO(11) -- explicit hypercharge generator identification
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/particles/generation_structure.md`
**Status**: Complete
**Previous**: S325 (CKM/PMNS + dark quark hypercharge)

---

## Outcome

Identified the explicit U(1)_Y embedding in SO(11). The complex structure J from F=C breaks SO(4) -> SU(2)_R x U(1)_L, giving the SM electroweak structure directly. ALL pNGBs are SU(2)_L doublets with Y = +/-1/2. Three S325 claims RETRACTED as incorrect.

## Key Findings

1. **F=C breaks SO(4) -> SU(2) x U(1)** [DERIVATION]: J = -2*L1 commutes with ALL of SU(2)_R (since [L,R]=0) but NOT with L2, L3. Physical identification: SU(2)_L(SM) = SU(2)_R (anti-self-dual), U(1)_Y(SM) = U(1)_L (generated by L1 ~ J). Y eigenvalues = +/-1/2.

2. **Pipeline's u(1) = broken generator** [DERIVATION]: The pipeline's "u(1) from Im_C" is T_{0,s} (rotation mixing defect R^4 and internal R^7). This is a COSET generator of SO(11)/(SO(4)xSO(7)), hence a pNGB direction -- CANNOT be a gauge boson.

3. **ALL 28 pNGBs are SU(2)_L doublets** [DERIVATION]: R^4 = (2,2) under SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R has NO SU(2)_L singlet. This is independent of the U(1)_Y embedding -- it's forced by the SO(4) = SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R structure alone.

4. **Pipeline's su(2) from Im_H = axial SU(2)_A** [DERIVATION]: The generators {T12, T13, T23} acting on Im_H directions equal L_a - R_a (axial combination), not L_a + R_a (vector/custodial).

5. **Centralizer structure**: Centralizer of SU(3) in SO(4)xSO(7) has dim 7, rank 3. Cartan: T_3L, T_3R, T_X. Possible T_X admixture in U(1)_Y from SO(7) sector -- requires fermion embedding (spinor 32) to determine.

## Retractions

- **S325 Finding #5**: "Dark quarks are SU(2)_L singlets [DERIVATION]" -> **RETRACTED**. Custodial singlet != SU(2)_L singlet. HP-014 logged.
- **S325 Finding #6**: "Dark quark Y = 0 preferred [CONJECTURE]" -> **RETRACTED**. Y = +/-1/2 from L1 eigenvalues.
- **S322 DM = pNGB color singlet**: Needs revision -- pNGB color singlet = Higgs doublet, not separate DM.

## What Survives (Unaffected by S328)

- 3 generations from Im(H) = 3 [DERIVATION]
- CKM mechanism from SO(3) breaking [DERIVATION]
- CP violation from quaternion non-commutativity [DERIVATION]
- H-parity exact symmetry [THEOREM]
- Colored pNGBs at ~TeV scale [CONJECTURE]

## Open Questions

1. **DM identity revision** (EQ-043 update): pNGB color singlet = Higgs. Where does DM come from? Spinor sector? Non-pNGB composite? (NEW, S328)
2. **T_X admixture**: Does U(1)_Y = pure L1, or L1 + alpha*T_X? Requires analyzing spinor 32 of SO(11) under SO(4) x SO(7). (NEW, S328)
3. **Colored pNGB phenomenology revision**: As SU(2)_L doublets with Y = +/-1/2, the LHC signatures change significantly from the S325 analysis.
4. **Mass hierarchy**: Still OPEN from S325.

## Key Context for Next Session

S328 resolved the U(1)_Y embedding question with a surprising result: F=C breaks SO(4) -> SU(2) x U(1) directly, giving the SM electroweak structure. The key insight is that J = -2*L1 (self-dual) commutes with ALL anti-self-dual generators, preserving full SU(2)_R. This is the physical SU(2)_L of the SM.

The major consequence: all colored pNGBs are SU(2)_L doublets, not singlets. This means the dark quark phenomenology from S322-S325 needs revision. The pNGB color singlet IS the Higgs -- DM must come from elsewhere (spinor sector most likely, cf. S317-S320 dark sector investigation).

The pipeline's abstract u(1)+su(2)+su(3) algebra is correct, but the specific generator identification (which su(2) is SU(2)_L, which u(1) is U(1)_Y) requires the SO(4) analysis done here. The pipeline's "u(1) from Im_C" is a broken generator and cannot be U(1)_Y.
