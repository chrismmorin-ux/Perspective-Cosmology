# Session S330: Red Team v3.0 + Document Updates

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Comprehensive Red Team review update (v2.0 -> v3.0) and document propagation
**Topic**: Meta / framework assessment
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S257 (Red Team v2.0), S324 (publication sync)
**Next**: Continue launch preparation (S327 scope)

---

## Outcome

Completed Red Team v3.0 -- the first comprehensive adversarial review since S257 (70+ sessions ago). Updated probability estimate from 20-35% to 25-40%. Updated 4 primary documents and propagated the new probability to 5+ publication files.

## Key Findings

1. **Red Team v3.0 written** (`registry/RED_TEAM_SUMMARY_V3.md`): Full 3-critic adversarial review covering S258-S327. Probability updated to 25-40% (from 20-35%). 12 surviving criticisms ranked. 5 v2.0 criticisms improved/resolved. 3 new criticisms added (all MEDIUM or below). [ASSESSMENT]

2. **IRA reduction is the strongest structural advance**: 10->4 irreducible assumptions. 6 derived. [A-INTERPRETATION] tier eliminated entirely. Alpha chain has ZERO conjectural assumptions. This is the single most important change since v2.0. [ASSESSMENT]

3. **Tree-to-dressed bands provide systematic defense against numerology**: 16/16 band memberships predicted a priori (S308). Sub-ppm matches are part of a predictable pattern, not isolated coincidences. This partially mitigates the "post-hoc fitting" criticism. [ASSESSMENT]

4. **Dark matter sector creates experimental escape route**: DM mass (5.11 GeV), coupling (g=0), stability (H-parity EXACT), and density (asymmetric) provide concrete falsifiable predictions. If confirmed, derivation-vs-discovery becomes moot. [ASSESSMENT]

5. **Phase grades upgraded**: Overall C+ -> B-. Particles B- -> B. Cosmology C- -> C. Yang-Mills A- (new). Dark matter B- (new). [ASSESSMENT]

6. **Core epistemological challenge unchanged**: Derivation vs. discovery still CRITICAL. No human expert review after 200+ sessions. Monte Carlo still shows building blocks not special at percent-level. These are unchanged from v2.0. [ASSESSMENT]

7. **Three new criticisms identified**:
   - NEW-6: DM prediction convenience (m_e * 10000 is round). MEDIUM.
   - NEW-7: IRA reduction may be partly semantic (Weinberg criterion is meta-assumption). MEDIUM.
   - NEW-8: Corrections/retractions show fragility (S291, S320). MEDIUM-LOW.

No new verification scripts (this session is assessment, not calculation).

## Open Questions

1. **Monte Carlo re-run**: The S170 Monte Carlo hasn't been re-run with expanded prediction set or sub-ppm test. Highest-ROI statistical analysis. (EQ: not filed)
2. **LLM Challenge v4**: Current-generation models (Claude 4.5, GPT-4.5) on expanded axiom set. (EQ: backlog item)
3. **g-2 from QM chain**: Physics Rigor critic's test -- derive g=2+O(alpha/pi) from framework's Hilbert space derivation. (EQ: not filed)
4. **PROP-003 completion**: Verify all publication files updated. Agent updated 5 files but completion not verified.

## Key Context for Next Session

Red Team v3.0 is written and probability propagated to all key documents. The assessment is: 25-40% genuine physics, up from 20-35%, driven by IRA reduction (10->4), 5 conjecture resolutions, Yang-Mills CANONICAL, and dark matter sector. The core derivation-vs-discovery question remains CRITICAL. Highest-ROI actions: external review (via launch), LLM Challenge v4, Monte Carlo re-run at sub-ppm.
