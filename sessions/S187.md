# Session 187: Phase 4A — Alpha Chain Audit

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Focus**: Phase 4 of formalization plan — Particle Physics Audit, sub-phase 4A (Alpha Chain)
**Topic**: Alpha derivation chain (CR-041, 4/111 correction, Step 5 mechanisms)
**Status**: COMPLETE (Phase 4A done; Phase 4B-4D surveyed and roadmapped)
**Previous**: S185 (Phase 3), S186 (mass formalization, parallel)

---

## Outcome

Phase 4A of the master formalization plan is COMPLETE. All three items (CR-041 audit, 4/111 trace, Step 5 mechanisms) resolved. Additionally, surveyed Phase 4B-4D scope to create a roadmap for subsequent sessions.

Key finding: The alpha derivation has 13 derived/standard-math steps, 3 [A-STRUCTURAL] assumptions, and 1 critical [CONJECTURE] (Step 15: interface generator count = 1/α). Step 5 is grade C — the single biggest gap. THM_0496 promoted SKETCH → DERIVATION.

## Key Findings

### 4A.1: CR-041 Alpha Chain Audit (RESOLVED)

Added comprehensive Section 13 to `ALPHA_DERIVATION_MASTER.md` (version 1.1 → 2.0):

**17-Step Classification**:
- **13 steps**: [D] derived or [I-MATH] standard mathematics
- **3 steps**: [A-STRUCTURAL] — maximality of n_d (Step 12), total dim = 15 (Step 13), prime attractor (Step 14)
- **1 step**: [CONJECTURE] — interface generator count = 1/α (Step 15, CRITICAL GAP)

**CR-041 Findings Resolved**:
- C-1: F=C now DERIVED from directed time (THM_0485 CANONICAL) — not retrodiction
- C-2: n_d maximality tagged [A-STRUCTURAL]
- C-3: n_c = 15-4 = 11 tagged [A-STRUCTURAL: total=15]
- C-4: Generator → coupling tagged [A-IMPORT]
- C-5: Step 5 = critical gap ACKNOWLEDGED
- C-6: Canonical formula is 1/α = N_I + n_d/Φ₆(n_c)
- C-7: This audit section itself resolves "no complete classification exists"

**Honest assumption count**: 3 structural + 1 conjecture

### 4A.2: 4/111 Correction Trace (COMPLETE)

THM_0496 promoted SKETCH → DERIVATION. Four independent proofs of equal distribution:
1. Transitive group action on off-diagonal generators
2. Schur's lemma (unique invariant form)
3. Maximum entropy (Shannon, given no preferred channel)
4. Genericity (average over defect orientations)

**Assumption classification** (7 components added):
- The equal distribution itself is THEOREM-level math
- The correction form n_d/Φ₆(n_c) has one [A-STRUCTURAL] gap (why linear, not quadratic)
- Verification: 6/6 PASS

### 4A.3: Step 5 Mechanisms (DOCUMENTED)

Consolidated assessment added to `alpha_mechanism_derivation.md`:
- 5A, 5B: DEAD (circular, algebra error)
- 5C, 5D: ACTIVE, address different questions (form vs value), compatible
- 5E (unified 5C+5D): BEST current picture, grade C
- 5F (single-photon tilt): Provides physical mechanism for democracy

**Updated stale references**: THM_0491 now CANONICAL (was listed as SKETCH in 5F gaps), THM_0494 now DERIVATION with complete math proof.

## Phase 4B-4D Survey and Roadmap

### Phase 4B: Mass Formulas

| Formula | Status | Accuracy | Key Issue | Sessions Needed |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| m_p/m_e = 1836 + 11/72 | [DERIVATION] | 0.06 ppm | Why n_c (not n_d) in correction? | 1 |
| Higgs mass (4 paths) | [DERIVATION/CONJECTURE] | 0.057% | Choose canonical; CW mechanism incomplete | 1-2 |
| Top quark (Koide) | [DERIVATION] (ratios only) | 0.05% | Absolute mass not derived | 1 |
| Neutrino sector | [CONJECTURE] | 1.7% | R₃₁=33 locked, dynamics TBD | Already done (S167) |
| Dark matter m_DM | [DERIVATION] | BLIND | 5.11 GeV locked | Already done |

**Priority**: Higgs mass canonical selection (plan item 4B.2) — needs honest comparison of 4 competing paths.

### Phase 4C: Mixing Angles

| Parameter | Formula | Error | Key Issue | Sessions Needed |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| sin²θ_W | 28/121 | 843 ppm | Coset volume mechanism gap | 1-2 |
| CKM elements | DA ratios | 0.01-4% | ALL numerically discovered, not derived | 1-2 |
| theta_QCD | THM_0497 | — | DOWNGRADED (π₃(G₂) error CR-029) | 1 |
| PMNS angles | DA ratios | 0.01-3.2% | Same discovery vs derivation problem | 1 |

**Priority**: CKM formula search documentation (plan item 4C.1) — honest accounting of search space. S162 adversarial audit already done (27,397 DA ratios, joint P ~ 10⁻¹²).

### Phase 4D: Collider Phenomenology

| Item | Status | Key Issue | Sessions Needed |
|------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| EWSB (Higgs as pNGB) | S175 RESOLVED | Fermion hypercharges TBD | 0-1 |
| Beta functions | THM_04A3 DERIVATION | Mechanism gap (why n_c/Im_H?) | 1 |
| CW potential | Grade D+ (S179-180) | 3 conjectures: c_beta, y_t, xi | 1-2 |

**Priority**: Beta function mechanism (plan item 4D.2) — separate one-loop THEOREM from two-loop CONJECTURE.

### Estimated Sessions for Complete Phase 4

- 4B: 2-3 sessions (Higgs canonical selection, m_p/m_e documentation, top quark chain)
- 4C: 2-3 sessions (CKM search documentation, Weinberg derivation, theta_QCD honest assessment)
- 4D: 2-3 sessions (beta function separation, CW documentation, EWSB completion)
- **Total remaining**: 6-9 sessions

## Open Questions

1. **Step 5 dynamics**: Can the democratic counting assumption be derived from crystallization dynamics? F5 (non-democratic excitations) is AT RISK per S160.

2. **Higgs mass canonical path**: Four competing derivations exist. Which is canonical? Need honest comparison session.

3. **CKM derivation-vs-discovery**: All mixing angle formulas were numerically discovered. S162 adversarial audit quantified search space. Can ANY formula be derived from tilt matrix structure?

4. **theta_QCD new proof**: CR-029 killed the instanton trivialization argument. Is there a viable alternative via G₂ holonomy or octonionic discrete symmetry?

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 4A (Alpha Chain) is complete. The alpha derivation is well-classified: 13 derived steps, 3 structural assumptions, 1 critical conjecture (Step 15). THM_0496 promoted to DERIVATION. Step 5 is grade C with comprehensive documentation.

The remaining Phase 4 work (4B-4D: mass formulas, mixing angles, collider) is surveyed and roadmapped above. Estimated 6-9 sessions total. These can be worked in any order; the suggested priority is:
1. **4B.2** (Higgs mass canonical selection) — highest value, multiple competing paths
2. **4C.1** (CKM formula search documentation) — critical for derivation-vs-discovery
3. **4D.2** (Beta function mechanism separation) — clean THEOREM/CONJECTURE split

Phases 5 (Cosmology) and 6 (Gravity) from the master plan can also run in parallel with the remaining Phase 4 work.
