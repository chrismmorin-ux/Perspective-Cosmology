# Session S307

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: EQ-039: Tree-to-dressed coefficient unification + Band A predictions
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S283 (Tree-to-dressed: double-trace + cos(theta_W) + 3-loop)
**Next**: Monitor Belle II m_tau; cos(theta_W) C=dim(C)=2 needs m_W improvement

---

## Outcome

Resolved all three open questions from S283. (1) **sin^2+cos^2 mismatch RESOLVED**: 28/121 is MS-bar, 171/194 is on-shell -- different renormalization schemes, so sin^2+cos^2 != 1 is expected. The framework's implicit scheme conversion prediction Delta=0.00835 matches the SM experimental value Delta=0.00802 to 4.1% (non-trivial check). sqrt(93)/11 should NOT replace 171/194 -- it's 57x worse for the on-shell scheme. (2) **Band A dressed predictions computed**: m_tau/m_mu with C=1/33 corrects 70 ppm gap to 1.9 ppm residual (37x improvement). alpha_s with C=1/n_c corrects 208 ppm to 3 ppm. Both within measurement error. (3) **Coefficient unification**: No single formula, but band structure is the organizing principle. Absolute corrections (Band C) use multi-factor trace-normalized coefficients; relative corrections (Band B/A) use single-factor monomials. Bonus: cos(theta_W) coefficient **candidate C=dim(C)=2** gives 0.88 ppm residual (Band C level), matching extracted C=2.02 to 0.95%.

## Key Findings

1. **sin^2+cos^2 mismatch = scheme conversion** [DERIVATION]: sin^2=28/121 is MS-bar, cos=171/194 is on-shell. Their "mismatch" sin^2+cos^2=1.008 encodes the scheme conversion Delta = sin^2_MSbar - sin^2_OS = 0.00835. Experimental Delta = 0.00802. Match: 95.9% (4.1% error). sqrt(93)/11 as on-shell cos is 57x worse than 171/194 (5294 ppm vs 93 ppm). 16/17 PASS.

2. **m_tau/m_mu dressed prediction** [SPECULATION]: C=1/(Im_H*n_c)=1/33 in alpha/pi relative basis. Tree 185/11 = 16.8182 (70 ppm gap). Dressed 16.8170 (1.9 ppm residual, 0.03 sigma). Improvement: 37x. Testable: Belle II (~2027) targets m_tau to 20 ppm. Need ~23 ppm precision for 3-sigma test of the correction.

3. **alpha_s dressed prediction** [SPECULATION]: C=1/n_c=1/11 in alpha/pi relative basis. Tree 25/212 = 0.11792 (208 ppm gap). Dressed 0.11790 (3 ppm residual, 0.0004 sigma). Not constraining with current alpha_s uncertainty (8482 ppm).

4. **cos(theta_W) coefficient candidate** [SPECULATION]: C=dim(C)=2 in alpha/(16pi^2) basis gives cos_dressed = 0.88136183, residual 0.88 ppm (0.005 sigma). Extracted C = 2.019, match to dim(C) 0.95%. Same dim(C)=2 factor appears in alpha's double-trace (24/11 = 12/11 * **2**). Caution: large m_W uncertainty (147 ppm) means extraction is statistically weak.

5. **Coefficient unification: band structure principle** [CONJECTURE]: Band C (absolute, alpha^2/pi) -> multi-factor trace-normalized coefficients (24/11, 43/7). Band B (relative, alpha^2/pi) -> single-monomial inverses (1/n_d, 1/n_c, 1). Band A (relative, alpha/pi) -> dimensions or products (n_d, 1/n_c, 1/33). Absolute corrections need trace structure; relative corrections need only suppression factors. Sector-dominance maps physics type to algebraic structure.

## Open Questions

1. **cos(theta_W) C=dim(C)=2**: Needs m_W to ~1 MeV (from 13 MeV) for meaningful coefficient extraction. FCC-ee could provide this.
2. **m_mu/m_e residual = 8 ppm**: C=1/n_d gives 8.3 ppm residual, not great. Coefficient 1/n_d might need correction or the correction basis might differ.
3. **Three-loop residuals**: m_p/m_e dressed with C=43/7 has 0.0001 ppm residual (suspiciously good, 2.0 sigma). Is C_3 contributing?

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-039 is essentially COMPLETE. All three open questions from S283 resolved:
- sin^2+cos^2: scheme conversion [DERIVATION, 16/17 PASS]
- Band A predictions: m_tau/m_mu 1.9 ppm, alpha_s 3 ppm [SPECULATION, 20/20 PASS]
- Unification: band structure principle [CONJECTURE]

Bonus finding: cos coefficient candidate C=dim(C)=2 [SPECULATION].

EQ-039 priority: MEDIUM -> LOW (essentially complete, remaining work is monitoring).

36/37 total PASS across 2 scripts.
