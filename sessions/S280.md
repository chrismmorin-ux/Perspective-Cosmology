# Session S280

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Dimensional scale propagation: M_Pl -> all dimensionful quantities
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/meta/dimensional_scale_propagation.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S279 (Weinberg coefficient origin)
**Next**: Lambda_QCD computation from alpha_s + RG; or CC magnitude investigation

---

## Outcome

Mapped the complete dimensional scale propagation chain. Starting from M_Pl as the **single** free dimensional parameter, the framework propagates to **11 dimensionful predictions** via **16 derived dimensionless ratios**, using **zero additional scale inputs**. The quantities {h, G, l_P, t_P} are definitional (same parameter, different names). c is DERIVED (crystal isotropy). |Pi| is NOT independent of M_Pl -- the holographic path is tautological (S260).

## Key Findings

1. **One free parameter suffices** [DERIVATION]: M_Pl propagates through v = M_Pl * alpha^8 * sqrt(44/7) to all electroweak, hadronic, and leptonic mass scales. Every dimensionful prediction traces to exactly one scale input. 42/42 PASS.

2. **|Pi| is not independent** [THEOREM, S260]: |Pi| and M_Pl encode the same information. The holographic path |Pi| -> h is tautological. Removing |Pi| as a listed import loses nothing for scale propagation. |Pi| may have a role in CC magnitude (currently underived).

3. **Propagation chain depth**: v is depth 1 from M_Pl, bosons/m_p are depth 2, m_e is depth 3, m_mu is depth 4, m_tau is depth 5. Errors compound through chain but mass ratios cancel the base v/M_Pl error, remaining at ppm level.

4. **Gap identification**: Four quantities have no framework derivation: Lambda (CC magnitude, weakest link), Lambda_QCD (computable from alpha_s + RG but not computed), neutrino masses, dark matter mass. Lambda_QCD is the most accessible gap.

5. **Comparison to SM**: SM needs 19 free parameters + {h, c, G}. Framework replaces 19 with algebraic expressions and reduces 3 scale inputs to 1. This is remarkably tight.

6. **IRA ranking**: Cleanest chain steps are the lepton mass ratios (pure DA dims, no [A-PHYSICAL]). Weakest is m_H/v = 121/238 (algebraically natural but no dynamics).

## Open Questions

1. **Lambda_QCD from alpha_s + RG**: Since alpha_s = 25/212 IS derived, can Lambda_QCD be computed from standard RG running? This would extend the propagation chain to QCD scale. However, the RG running itself is an [A-IMPORT] from QFT.

2. **CC magnitude**: Can any of the three competing formulas for Lambda/M_Pl^4 be derived from first principles? This is the biggest remaining gap in scale propagation.

3. **Neutrino mass scale**: Could the seesaw relation m_nu ~ v^2/M_GUT combined with an SO(11) GUT scale provide the absolute neutrino mass? Requires M_GUT derivation.

## Key Context for Next Session

The scale propagation map is now complete and documented. The framework derives ALL dimensionful predictions from ONE scale input (M_Pl) plus algebraic dimensionless ratios. The most productive next steps are: (a) compute Lambda_QCD explicitly from alpha_s RG to extend the chain, or (b) tackle CC magnitude (the weakest link), or (c) continue any other open topic.
