# Session S341 — Alpha Accuracy: CCWZ Coleman-Weinberg Phase 2

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: CCWZ one-loop CW calculation, charge convention resolution, C_2 = 24/11 derivation
**Topic**: `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S337 (CCWZ Phase 1)
**Next**: Phase 3 (three-loop extension) or charge convention formal proof

---

## Outcome

Phase 2 of the CCWZ alpha accuracy program COMPLETE. Critical VEV correction: the neutral Higgs direction is h0 = (T_{0,4} - T_{2,4})/sqrt(2), not T_{0,4} as assumed in Phase 1. T_{0,4} alone breaks U(1)_EM because [Q_EM, T_{0,4}] != 0. The CW potential and alpha correction C_2 are identified as DIFFERENT one-loop diagrams. C_2 = 24/11 confirmed as structural EM coefficient using defect-only charges.

## Key Findings

1. **VEV CORRECTION [THEOREM]**: The neutral Higgs VEV is h0 = (T_{0,4} - T_{2,4})/sqrt(2), the Q_EM=0 eigenstate in the Higgs sector. [Q_EM, h0] = 0 verified in BOTH charge conventions. T_{0,4} alone has [Q_EM, T_{0,4}] != 0, breaking U(1)_EM.

2. **Gauge boson mass spectrum [DERIVATION]**: With the correct VEV direction, W+/W- massive (m^2 ~ sin^2(theta)), photon massless at ALL theta, gluons massless, T_X massless. Neutral mass matrix has rank 1 (Z massive, photon+T_X massless). V_CW(theta) ~ sin^4(theta) = standard composite Higgs form.

3. **CW vs Alpha distinction [DERIVATION]**: The Coleman-Weinberg potential (gauge bosons in loop -> Higgs potential) and the alpha correction C_2 (pNGB mode counting -> photon propagator) are DIFFERENT one-loop diagrams. CW depends on gauge couplings; C_2 depends on structural Q_EM charges. CW does NOT determine C_2.

4. **Charge convention resolved [DERIVATION]**: C_2 = 24/11 uses DEFECT-ONLY charges (Q_EM = R3 + L1) because the framework's tree alpha derives from structural EM counting. T_X is part of gauge structure, not structural EM definition.
   - Defect: sum(Q^2) = 14, colored = 12 -> C_2 = 12*(2/11) = 24/11
   - Full SM: sum(Q^2) = 50/3, colored = 44/3 -> C_2 = 8/3 (doesn't match)
   - Beta functions: beta_defect = 7/3, beta_full = 25/9 (both differ from C_2)

5. **Self-consistent cubic confirmed [DERIVATION]**: 1/alpha + (24/11)*alpha^2/pi = 15211/111 gives 1/alpha = 137.035999053, error 0.0009 ppm from CODATA 2022.

## Open Questions

1. **Phase 3**: Can three-loop extension narrow the 5.9-sigma gap further? (EQ-039)
2. **Formal proof**: Why structural (defect) charges rather than physical (full) charges? Current argument is consistency-based. Can this be derived from first principles?
3. **The h0_b direction**: (T_{1,4} - T_{3,4})/sqrt(2) is also neutral — what is its physical role? (second Higgs doublet component?)

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 2 resolves the charge convention question: C_2 = 24/11 uses defect-only Q_EM = R3 + L1 because alpha's tree value derives from structural EM counting, not physical scattering. The CW potential is a separate calculation (gauge boson masses in loop) that generates V(h) ~ sin^4(h/f). The CRITICAL correction is the VEV direction: h0 = (T_{0,4} - T_{2,4})/sqrt(2), not T_{0,4}. This must be propagated to any downstream calculation using the Higgs VEV.
