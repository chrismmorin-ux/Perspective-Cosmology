# Session 235: Hidden-Sector B Values via SO(3) Irrep Decomposition (EQ-012)

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Derive individual hidden-sector B values {18, -10, 1} from process-level Born rule
**Topic**: Cyclotomic pattern (EQ-012)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S232 (sector budgets), S226 (sum rules), S216 (three-sector decomposition)

---

## Outcome

The hidden-sector B values {18, -10, 1} decompose **UNIQUELY** as B_l = dim_l * w_l under the SO(3) irrep decomposition of End_R(Im_H) = M_3(R) = 1 + 3 + 5, where the weights {R, C*Im_H, -C} = {1, 6, -2} are clean framework quantities. Out of 6 permutations, exactly 1 gives all-integer weights that are recognizable framework expressions.

Additionally: the non-trivial weights satisfy a **crossed Casimir formula**: w_l = (-1)^(l+1) * C_2(Im_H - l), connecting them to standard SO(3) representation theory.

**Session pass/fail**: PARTIAL PASS — identifies the specific structural mechanism (SO(3) irrep decomposition with crossed Casimir weights) but the weight assignment remains [CONJECTURE] not [DERIVATION]. The structural obstruction is identified: deriving the crossed Casimir coupling from first principles.

## Key Findings

### 1. SO(3) Irrep Decomposition of End_R(Im_H) [MATHEMATICAL FACT]

End_R(Im_H) = End_R(R^3) = M_3(R) decomposes under SO(3) (generation rotations) as:

| Irrep l | Name | dim(2l+1) | Description |
|---------|------|-----------|-------------|
| l=0 | Scalar | 1 | Multiples of identity matrix |
| l=1 | Antisymmetric | 3 | so(3) Lie algebra generators |
| l=2 | Symmetric traceless | 5 | Traceless symmetric matrices |
| **Total** | | **9 = Im_H^2** | |

This is standard representation theory: SO(3) acts on M_n(R) by conjugation, decomposing into irreps l = 0, 1, ..., n-1 with dims 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1.

### 2. Unique Clean-Weight Assignment [MATHEMATICAL FACT + CONJECTURE]

B_l = dim_l * w_l where w_l are clean framework quantities:

| l | dim | w_l | w_l framework | B = dim*w | Formula |
|---|-----|-----|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | R | 1 | m_u/m_s |
| 1 | 3 | 6 | C*Im_H | 18 | v/m_p |
| 2 | 5 | -2 | -C | -10 | m_mu/m_e |

**Uniqueness proof by exhaustion**: Of the 6 permutations of {1, -10, 18} assigned to {dim 1, dim 3, dim 5}:
- Only 1 gives all-integer weights: (1, 18, -10) -> (1, 6, -2)
- This is the ONLY assignment where all weights are clean framework quantities

[MATHEMATICAL FACT] that the unique assignment exists. [CONJECTURE] that weights SHOULD be framework quantities.

### 3. Crossed Casimir Formula [CONJECTURE with structure]

The SO(3) Casimirs C_2(l) = l(l+1) are themselves framework quantities:
- C_2(0) = 0
- C_2(1) = 2 = C
- C_2(2) = 6 = C * Im_H

The non-trivial weights satisfy: **w_l = (-1)^(l+1) * C_2(Im_H - l)**
- l=1: w = (-1)^2 * C_2(2) = +6 = C*Im_H
- l=2: w = (-1)^3 * C_2(1) = -2 = -C

Each irrep's weight is (up to sign) the Casimir of the OTHER non-trivial irrep. This is a "crossed coupling" structure.

### 4. Symmetry Breaking: Why Unequal Distribution [DERIVATION]

In the crystal sector, U(n_c) acts transitively on EM channels -> equal distribution (Schur's lemma). In the hidden sector, U(Im_O) does NOT act transitively on End_R(Im_H) because Im_H is a PROPER SUBSPACE of Im_O.

The Cayley-Dickson structure Im_O = Im_H + eH breaks U(7) to U(3) x U(4). Under this reduced symmetry, the 9 endomorphism modes split into 3 SO(3) irreps with potentially different weights. This is a [DERIVATION]-level argument for WHY the distribution is unequal.

### 5. Interference and Negative B [SPECULATION]

B = -10 for m_mu/m_e comes from the symmetric traceless irrep with weight w = -C = -2. The negative sign has a physical interpretation: symmetric traceless endomorphisms are NOT elements of the Lie algebra u(Im_O). Their coupling to EM channels goes through a different mechanism (anticommutator rather than commutator), introducing a sign flip. This allows destructive interference.

The sum 18 + (-10) + 1 = 9 = Im_H^2 is a unitarity/completeness condition: total signed weight across all processes equals total mode count.

### 6. Derived Quantities [MATHEMATICAL FACT]

- sum(dim_l * w_l^2) = 1 + 108 + 20 = **129 = Im_H * Phi_6(Im_O) = 3 * 43**
- sum(w_l^2) = 1 + 36 + 4 = **41 = Im_O^2 - O = 49 - 8**
- prod(B_l) = **-180** = prod(dims) * prod(w) = 15 * (-12) = dim(SU(n_d)) * (-n_d * Im_H)
- sum(B_l^2) = **425** = 1 + 324 + 100

The identity sum(dim_l * w_l^2) = Im_H * D (where D=43 is the hidden sector denominator) directly connects the weight distribution to sector parameters.

### 7. SU(3) vs SO(3) [DERIVATION]

SU(3) gives only 2 irreps (1 + 8), insufficient for 3 hidden formulas. SO(3) gives exactly 3 irreps (1 + 3 + 5). The SU(3) adjoint 8 decomposes under SO(3) as 3 + 5. Im_H = R^3 is a REAL vector space, making SO(3) the natural symmetry group.

### 8. Cross-Sector Observation [OBSERVATION, not derived]

A(v/m_p) - A(m_mu/m_e) = 262 - 207 = 55 = C(n_c, 2) = cross-sector channel count from S216. Suggestive but A values are not framework-derived.

## Confidence Assessment

| Sub-claim | Confidence | Justification |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| M_3(R) = 1+3+5 under SO(3) | [MATHEMATICAL FACT] | Standard representation theory |
| Unique clean-weight assignment | [MATHEMATICAL FACT] | Verified by exhaustion (6 permutations) |
| Weights = {R, C*Im_H, -C} | [CONJECTURE] | No first-principles derivation of WHY |
| Crossed Casimir formula | [CONJECTURE] | Verified but mechanism unknown |
| Formula-to-irrep assignment | [CONJECTURE] | Physically motivated but post-hoc |
| Symmetry breaking mechanism | [DERIVATION] | Im_H proper subspace of Im_O |
| Negative B from interference | [SPECULATION] | Plausible but not derived |

**EQ-012 update**: Gap narrowed from 1252 alternatives to UNIQUE assignment (given SO(3) decomposition + clean framework weight ansatz). The structural obstruction is now specific: derive the crossed Casimir coupling w_l = (-1)^(l+1) * C_2(Im_H-l) from the Born rule on End_R(Im_H).

## Open Questions (EQ references)

1. **Crossed Casimir coupling** (EQ-012 remaining gap): Derive w_l = (-1)^(l+1) * C_2(Im_H-l) from first principles. WHY does each irrep couple through the Casimir of the complementary irrep?
2. **Physical assignment**: Is m_u/m_s -> scalar, v/m_p -> antisymmetric, m_mu/m_e -> symmetric traceless physically forced or post-hoc?
3. **Lie algebra vs non-Lie algebra coupling**: The antisymmetric part is IN so(3) c u(7); the symmetric part is NOT. Does this structural difference actually determine the sign?
4. **129 = Im_H * D identity**: Is sum(dim_l * w_l^2) = Im_H * Phi_6(Im_O) a coincidence of the specific weights, or does it follow from a general principle?

## Key Context for Next Session

The hidden-sector B values {18, -10, 1} now have a STRUCTURAL MECHANISM: SO(3) irrep decomposition of End_R(Im_H) with crossed Casimir weights. The decomposition is unique given clean framework weight requirements (1 out of 6 permutations).

The improvement over S232: reduces the unexplained content from "1252 alternative partitions" to "one physical assumption (crossed Casimir coupling)." The crossed Casimir formula w_l = (-1)^(l+1) * C_2(Im_H-l) is the new frontier -- deriving it would close EQ-012.

The symmetry breaking argument (WHY unequal, unlike the crystal sector) is [DERIVATION]-level: Im_H being a proper subspace of Im_O breaks U(7) transitivity. What remains [CONJECTURE] is the specific weight assignment.

Overall status: the 5 Phi_6 formulas now have 3 layers of explanation:
1. **Denominators** {111, 43, 13}: [DERIVATION] from Lie algebra structure (S89/S216)
2. **Sector budgets** {4, 9, 1}: [DERIVATION for crystal, CONJECTURE for hidden] from End_R(V) (S232)
3. **Individual B values** {4; 18,-10,1; 1}: [CONJECTURE with uniqueness] from SO(3) irreps + crossed Casimir (S235)
