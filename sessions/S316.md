# Session S316: DM sigma_SI — Higgs Invisible Width Excludes Standard Portal

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: Predict DM-nucleon cross-section (sigma_SI) for m_DM = 5.11 GeV
**Topic**: Dark matter / EQ-013 next steps
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S315 (EQ-013 FULLY RESOLVED, exponent derived)

## Outcome

The standard Higgs portal cross-section for m_DM = 5.11 GeV is sigma_SI = 7.1 × 10^{-46} cm^2. However, this scenario is **EXCLUDED by the LHC**: since m_DM < m_h/2, the Higgs can decay to DM pairs, giving BR(h -> invisible) = 51%, far exceeding the LHC limit of 11%. This is a sharp constraint: the DM-Higgs coupling must be suppressed by at least factor 3 from the naive value, meaning the dark generation's mass CANNOT come from the Higgs VEV with standard Yukawa coupling. The maximum allowed cross-section is sigma_SI < 8.2 × 10^{-47} cm^2, which is below the Xe neutrino floor at 5 GeV. If the coupling is xi-suppressed (composite mass scenario), sigma_SI ~ 8 × 10^{-49} cm^2.

## Key Findings

1. **Standard Higgs portal EXCLUDED** [THEOREM by computation + LHC data]:
   - y_DM(std) = sqrt(2) × m_DM/v = 0.0294
   - Gamma(h -> DM DM_bar) = 4.25 MeV (comparable to Gamma_SM = 4.1 MeV)
   - BR(h -> invisible) = 51%, limit is 11%
   - The naive sigma_SI = 7.1 × 10^{-46} cm^2 is academic (scenario excluded)

2. **DM mass mechanism must differ from SM fermions** [DERIVATION from finding 1]:
   - DM mass does NOT scale linearly with Higgs VEV
   - Dark generation is "fully composite" — mass from strong dynamics at scale f
   - Consistent with dark gen being the "1" singlet in G_2 -> SU(3) branching

3. **Maximum allowed sigma_SI** [CONSTRAINT from LHC]:
   - y_DM(max) = 0.010 (from BR < 11%)
   - sigma_SI < 8.2 × 10^{-47} cm^2
   - Below Xe neutrino floor (~4 × 10^{-45} at 5 GeV)

4. **Composite scenario sigma_SI** [CONJECTURE]:
   - If coupling xi-suppressed: g_eff = m_DM × xi/v = 6.9 × 10^{-4}
   - sigma_SI ~ 7.8 × 10^{-49} cm^2
   - BR(h -> inv) = 0.11% (well allowed)
   - Below neutrino floor for all targets

5. **Dark matter stability** [DERIVATION from G_2 branching]:
   - "1" in 7 -> 3 + 3bar + 1 is topologically separated from visible gens
   - Dark parity automatic from representation structure
   - No imposed symmetry needed

6. **All scenarios unexcluded** [assessment]:
   - Current best limit at 5 GeV: LZ Migdal ~3 × 10^{-43} cm^2
   - All framework scenarios 1000x+ below current limits
   - Next-gen detection challenging (below neutrino floor)

## Derivation Chain

```
m_DM = 5.11 GeV [DERIVATION, S315]
  + m_DM < m_h/2 [A-IMPORT: m_h from PDG]
  -> h -> DM DM_bar kinematically open [D]

y_DM(std) = sqrt(2) * m_DM / v [A-PHYSICAL: mass from Higgs VEV]
  -> Gamma(h->inv) = 4.25 MeV [D]
  -> BR = 51% > 11% limit [A-IMPORT: LHC]
  -> EXCLUDED [THEOREM]

THEREFORE:
  DM-Higgs coupling suppressed [D from exclusion]
  -> y_DM < 0.010 [D from BR < 11%]
  -> sigma_SI < 8.2e-47 cm^2 [D]

If xi-suppressed [A-PHYSICAL]:
  -> g_eff = m_DM * xi / v [CONJECTURE]
  -> sigma_SI ~ 8e-49 cm^2 [CONJECTURE]
```

## Open Questions

1. **Which coupling scenario?** (EQ-042): Framework must specify whether DM-Higgs coupling is zero (scenario B), xi-suppressed (scenario C), or something else. The G_2 branching structure should constrain this.
2. **Dark sector confinement**: Does the dark generation have its own QCD? If dark quarks confine, the lightest dark baryon (not fermion) is the DM candidate, changing the mass and coupling predictions.
3. **Relic abundance consistency**: Framework predicts Omega_m = 63/200. Does the suppressed DM-Higgs coupling give the right thermal relic abundance? Or is the abundance set by a non-thermal mechanism?
4. **Annual modulation**: At m_DM = 5.11 GeV with sigma_SI < 8e-47, is there any signal at DAMA/LIBRA? (Almost certainly not — orders of magnitude below DAMA-preferred region.)
5. **Complementary probes**: Indirect detection (gamma rays, neutrinos from DM annihilation), collider mono-X searches, and DM self-interactions may be more promising than direct detection for this scenario.

## Key Context for Next Session

The sigma_SI analysis revealed a **sharp LHC constraint**: standard Higgs portal is excluded for m_DM = 5.11 GeV because BR(h -> invisible) would be 51%. This REQUIRES the dark generation mass to come from a different mechanism than SM fermion masses (composite dynamics rather than Higgs VEV). The maximum allowed sigma_SI < 8.2 × 10^{-47} cm^2 is below the Xe neutrino floor, making direct detection very challenging. The next step is to determine the actual DM-Higgs coupling from the framework's composite structure, and to check consistency with the Omega_m = 63/200 prediction.
