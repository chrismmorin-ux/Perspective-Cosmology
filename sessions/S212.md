# Session 212: Fermion Embedding — Spinorial (MCHM4)

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Collider-crystallization — resolve MCHM4 vs MCHM5 fermion embedding
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S210 (EWSB testable predictions, 6 predictions, MCHM4/5 ambiguous)

---

## Outcome

Resolved the MCHM4 vs MCHM5 ambiguity from S210. The framework's division algebra fermion content (15 = 1+2+4+8 per generation) matches the SO(11) spinor representation (32), not the fundamental (11). The fundamental is excluded by counting alone (11 < 15). This determines spinorial embedding (MCHM4-type): kappa_f = kappa_V = sqrt(117/121) ≈ 0.983. All Higgs couplings are universally modified by the same factor. One new script, 23/23 PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **[I-MATH] Fundamental rep too small**: SO(11) fundamental has dim 11. Under SO(4)×SO(7): 11 → (4,1) ⊕ (1,7). Only 11 components — cannot fit 15 SM fermions per generation. The spinor (dim 32) is the unique representation between 11 and 55 (adjoint) that fits.

2. **[DERIVATION] Division algebra dims = spinor structure**: 1, 2, 4, 8 = 2⁰, 2¹, 2², 2³. This power-of-2 pattern is characteristic of Clifford algebra/spinor decompositions. Sum = 2⁴ - 1 = 15. With ν_R: 16 = half-spinor of SO(10) ⊂ spinor of SO(11).

3. **[I-MATH] Spinor decomposition under SM gauge group**: SO(11) spinor 32 → (spinor₄, spinor₇) = 4×8 under SO(4)×SO(7). The spinor₇ = 8 → 1+7 under G₂ → 1+1+3+3̄ under SU(3). Full decomposition gives 32 = 16 + 16', where one 16 = 15 SM + ν_R.

4. **[DERIVATION] kappa_f = kappa_V (universal modification)**: Spinorial embedding gives MCHM4-type coupling: kappa_f = sqrt(1-ξ) = sqrt(117/121) ≈ 0.983. Same as kappa_V. The key discriminator kappa_f/kappa_V = 1 exactly (vs 0.966 for fundamental/MCHM5).

5. **Experimental implications updated**: Universal 1.67% modification harder to detect than MCHM5's 5%. HL-LHC marginal (1.1σ). FCC-ee decisive (5.6σ). The framework's EWSB predictions are now simpler but need next-generation colliders.

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Top Yukawa from SO(11)**: Now that embedding is spinorial, can y_t ≈ 1 be derived from SO(11) partial compositeness with specific composite sector dynamics?
2. **Derive xi from dynamics**: xi = n_d/n_c² remains [CONJECTURE]. Need vacuum alignment calculation.
3. **kappa_lambda (triple Higgs)**: Depends on Higgs potential shape, not embedding. Separate calculation needed — likely (1-2ξ)/√(1-ξ) ≈ 0.950 but must verify for MCHM4 potential.
4. **Colored pNGB mass from first principles**: Still open from S210.
5. **Nu_R prediction**: The spinor naturally includes ν_R (16 = 15 + 1). This is a structural prediction — right-handed neutrinos should exist. Connects to neutrino mass investigation (S167).

## Key Context for Next Session

The fermion embedding ambiguity is resolved: spinorial (MCHM4). The framework now predicts UNIVERSAL Higgs coupling modification kappa = sqrt(117/121), the simplest possible composite Higgs signature. The S210 MCHM5 prediction (kappa_f ≈ 0.950) is superseded. The remaining open items are: (a) derive xi from dynamics, (b) top Yukawa from SO(11), (c) colored pNGB mass, (d) triple Higgs coupling verification. The spinor embedding also predicts ν_R existence as a bonus.
