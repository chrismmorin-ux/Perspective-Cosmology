# Session S298: IRA-04 Quartic Coupling Form Resolution

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: IRA-04 — Commutator-trace coupling form on Hom(R^4, R^7)
**Topic**: Irreducible assumptions (`framework/IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md`)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S297 (CONJ-A2), S286 (CONJ-B1/IRA-03)
**Next**: See open questions

## Outcome

**IRA-04 PARTIALLY RESOLVED**. The commutator-trace form Tr((eps*eps^T)^2) with positive coefficient is DERIVED from the boundedness of the embedded Sym_0(R^11) potential [THEOREM]. The residual — the ratio rho = c_4/b_4 — is classified as [A-STRUCTURAL, LOW impact], affecting only shape mode masses. IRA count stays 8 but IRA-04's impact downgraded from MEDIUM to LOW.

## Key Findings

1. **Exact coefficient decomposition** [THEOREM]: Block expansion of the embedded Sym_0(R^11) potential V = u*(Tr phi^2)^2 + v*Tr(phi^4) around the (4,7) vacuum gives b_4 = 4u (from [Tr phi^2]^2 only) and c_4 = 2v (from Tr(phi^4) only). No cross-contamination between u and v. The ratio rho = c_4/b_4 = v/(2u).

2. **c_4 > 0 is a mathematical theorem** [THEOREM]: Bounded embedded potential requires v > 0. Since c_4 = 2v, this gives c_4 > 0 without any physics input. This is Argument D (strongest of four independent arguments).

3. **Rank selection theorem** [THEOREM]: c_4 > 0 <=> f(r) = r/(b_4*r + c_4) is increasing <=> rank r* = min(4,7) = 4 <=> democratic (4,7) breaking. The sign of c_4 determines the breaking pattern uniquely.

4. **Hessian stability** [THEOREM]: At the democratic minimum (all sigma_i = sigma), the radial eigenvalue = 4|a_2| (always positive, independent of rho), and 3 shape eigenvalues = 4|a_2|*c_4/(4*b_4 + c_4) (positive iff c_4 > 0).

5. **Residual classified** [A-STRUCTURAL, LOW]: The ratio rho = c_4/b_4 determines only the shape-to-radial mass ratio m^2_shape/m^2_radial = rho/(4+rho). It does NOT affect: breaking pattern, gauge group, alpha, Weinberg angle, Omega_m, or any currently-derived prediction.

6. **Embedded vs intrinsic reconciliation**: These address different questions. Embedded asks "which (p,q)?" while intrinsic asks "what VEV structure given (4,7)?". The intrinsic picture is correct for IRA-04 because CCP already forces n_d=4. The "cubic needed for (4,7)" in embedded picture is an artifact of using the larger space Sym_0(R^11).

7. **Nielsen-Hughes 11/3 decomposition** (from S296): NOT applicable to IRA-04 — it concerns gauge beta functions (SO(11) running), not the quartic potential on Hom(R^4,R^7). The CW potential cannot pin the v/u ratio anyway.

## Derivation Chain

```
CCP [AXIOM]
  -> crystallization on Gr(4,11) [DERIVED]
  -> tilt eps in Hom(R^4, R^7) [DERIVED]
  -> SO(4)xSO(7) invariance [DERIVED]
  -> FFT: invariants = f(eps^T eps) [I-MATH: Weyl, Procesi]
  -> Z_2: all invariants even [THEOREM S285]
  -> Quartic lowest non-trivial [THEOREM S259]
  -> Exactly 2 quartic invariants: (Tr G)^2 and Tr(G^2) [THEOREM S285]
  -> Bounded embedded potential requires v > 0 [NECESSITY]
  -> c_4 = 2v > 0 [THEOREM, this session]
  -> Rank 4 (democratic) minimum [THEOREM, this session]
  -> All shape modes massive [THEOREM, this session]
  -> Ratio rho = c_4/b_4 = v/(2u) remains [A-STRUCTURAL, LOW]
```

## Open Questions

1. **Shape mode mass spectrum**: Can rho = c_4/b_4 be observed? What physical signatures would distinguish different values of rho?
2. **CW loop correction to rho**: Does the one-loop CW potential on Gr(4,11) prefer a specific value of rho, even if the tree-level ratio is undetermined?
3. **Casimir connection**: The Casimir eigenvalue ratios depend on rho. Does matching to observed Casimir-Polder forces constrain rho?

## Key Context for Next Session

IRA-04 is now partially resolved. The form of the quartic coupling (c_4 > 0, which selects Tr(G^2) with positive coefficient) is derived as a THEOREM from boundedness. The residual (ratio rho) is genuinely irreducible at LOW impact. IRA inventory: 8 total, all partially or fully characterized. The next high-value target would be investigating whether any of the [A-PHYSICAL] assumptions (IRA-06 through IRA-09) can be further justified, or pursuing new physics (LLM Challenge v3, Yang-Mills extensions, etc.).
