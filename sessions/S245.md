# Session 245: Crystallization Catalog — QCD Phase + EW Baryogenesis (Gap Analysis Session B)

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Gap Analysis Session B — upgrade DERIVATION GAP entries #51, #52, #54, #67
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog upgrade
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S243 (Gap Analysis Session A: 9 NEAR-MISS upgrades)
**Next**: Session C (gravitational scattering batch, #29-32, #79) or physics investigations

---

## Outcome

4 entries upgraded R→C, exceeding the expected yield of 2-3. Both weakest sub-catalogs opened: QCD phase 0%→75%, baryogenesis 0%→25%. Stretch goal #54 (color superconductivity) achieved. Catalog tag distribution: **3D/49C/47R** (was 3D/45C/51R). Two new verification scripts: 39 tests total, all PASS.

Key finding: N_c=3 algebraic uniqueness theorem for CFL diquark channel (antisym = anti-fund iff N_c=3). EW baryogenesis honestly ruled out (v_c/T_c ~ 0.14 << 1).

## Key Findings

1. **[THEOREM] Antisymmetric = anti-fundamental uniqueness**: N_c(N_c-1)/2 = N_c iff N_c²-3N_c = 0 iff N_c = 3. This means the CFL phase of color superconductivity (diquark in anti-3) is structurally unique to SU(3). Verified algebraically.

2. **[DERIVATION] QGP Stefan-Boltzmann DOF**: g_qgp = 2(N_c²-1) + (7/8)×4×N_c×N_f = 47.5 for N_c=3, N_f=3. Strong N_c-sensitivity: g_qgp(N_c=2) = 24.5 (-48%), g_qgp(N_c=4) = 72.0 (+52%).

3. **[DERIVATION] Confinement crossover order**: Z(N_c) center symmetry of SU(N_c) determines transition order. Z(3) for N_c=3 gives weak first-order (pure gauge) or crossover (N_f=2+1). Sensitive to N_c via Columbia plot structure.

4. **[DERIVATION, negative] EW baryogenesis**: Composite Higgs with xi=4/121 gives v_c/T_c ~ 0.14 << 1. Phase transition too weak for sphaleron washout suppression. Honest negative prediction — EW baryogenesis disfavored, leptogenesis structurally preferred.

5. **[DERIVATION] Critical temperature**: T_0 = √(α/c_th) = 156.3 GeV from composite Higgs finite-T potential with proper dimensional analysis. Matches expected EW scale.

## Open Questions

1. **Session C feasibility** (EQ-related): Can Einstein equations reach [DERIVATION] quality for gravitational scattering batch (#29-32, #79)? Grade currently C-. 5 potential upgrades.
2. **Leptogenesis path** (EQ-025): With EW baryogenesis ruled out, leptogenesis becomes the preferred mechanism. Does the SO(11) spinor embedding give enough structure for M_N constraints?
3. **Remaining 4 NEAR-MISS**: #2 (muon decay), #3 (charged pion), #18 (Moller), #50 (Lamb shift) — each has specific complications blocking trivial upgrade.

## Key Context for Next Session

Gap Analysis Session B is COMPLETE. The catalog is now at **3D/49C/47R** with 64 verification scripts and 823 tests. The two weakest sub-catalogs (QCD phase, baryogenesis) have been opened. Session C (gravitational scattering) is the logical next step but depends on Einstein equations quality assessment. The EW baryogenesis negative result (v_c/T_c ~ 0.14) is a genuine framework prediction that could be highlighted in publications as an honest constraint rather than a gap.
