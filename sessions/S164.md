# Session 164 — 2026-01-30

**Focus**: Single-photon tilt formalization + dimensionless constant taxonomy
**Topic**: `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S159 (Step 5 tasks), S160 (Weinberg gap analysis)

## Outcome

Formalized the single-photon tilt derivation of alpha as THM_04A2 (SKETCH), decomposed the 137 interface modes by gauge sector, classified 15 framework constants into 5 mechanism categories, and established 6 falsification criteria. Four verification scripts written, all passing (83/83 total tests).

## Key Findings

1. **THM_04A2: Single-photon tilt** [DERIVATION/CONJECTURE]: A single quantum of tilt excitation in the N_I = 137 dimensional interface Hilbert space, with no preferred direction, yields Born-rule probability P = 1/N_I = 1/137 per mode. With correction: 1/alpha = 15211/111 (0.27 ppm). Two gaps remain: "generic direction" -> "uniform superposition" formalization (HIGH), and Born rule noise model is A-STRUCTURAL (HIGH).

2. **Mode sector decomposition** [DERIVATION/CONJECTURE]: 137 = 16 (defect) + 121 (crystal). Crystal decomposes as 110 + 10 + 1 (off-diagonal + Cartan + U(1)). EM channels = 111 = Phi_6(n_c). Goldstones = 28 = n_d * Im_O. SM gauge generators = 12 = 8 + 3 + 1. Two counting regimes: EW uses Goldstone fraction, strong uses group dimension.

3. **Constant mechanism taxonomy** [DERIVATION]: Five categories identified: (1) Tilt-type using N_I/Born rule (alpha, m_p/m_e, delta T/T, eta), (2) Relational-type using algebra dimension ratios (sin^2 theta_W, Koide Q, Omega_Lambda, Omega_m), (3) Attractor-type using prime structure (cos theta_W on-shell, Koide theta), (4) Slow-roll-type from crystallization potential (n_s, r), (5) Structural-type from dimensional matching (n_gen, l_1). 15 constants classified, 7 Tier 1, 8 Tier 2.

4. **Falsification criteria** [DERIVATION]: Six criteria established. F5 (non-democratic excitations) is AT RISK due to S160 showing standard QFT gives Dynkin weighting. F6 (tree-level gauge kinetic) is OPEN. F1-F3 are SAFE. F4 is UNCERTAIN.

5. **Step 5F added** to alpha mechanism derivation as parallel option (grade C-). Provides physical mechanism for democratic counting in Steps 2-3 via Born rule. Complements 5D (crystallization) and 5E (unified). Does NOT resolve gauge kinetic term normalization gap.

## Open Questions

1. **Can "generic direction" -> "uniform superposition" be made rigorous?** THM_04A2 Step 5 currently gives three motivating arguments but no proof. This is the most important gap.
2. **Why two counting regimes?** EW uses Goldstone fraction (28/121), strong uses group dimension (8). What determines which regime applies?
3. **10 Cartan generators unassigned.** In the mode decomposition, the 10 diagonal generators of u(11) have no physical role identified.
4. **Attractor-type mechanism poorly understood.** Category 3 constants (prime structure) have the weakest derivation chain. What selects primes like 73, 97, 194?
5. **F5 is AT RISK.** S160 showed standard QFT contradicts democratic counting. The framework needs a non-perturbative mechanism to justify equal mode weights.

## Key Context for Next Session

The single-photon tilt picture (THM_04A2) provides the clearest physical interpretation of alpha = 1/137: Born-rule probability of one tilt quantum in 137 interface modes. But two critical gaps remain — formalizing the uniform superposition and justifying democratic counting against standard QFT's Dynkin-index weighting (S160). The mode sector decomposition shows clean structure but the two counting regimes (EW: fraction, Strong: dimension) need explanation. The constant taxonomy reveals that framework predictions use five distinct mechanisms, with tilt-type and relational-type being structurally independent.
