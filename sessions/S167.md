# Session 167 — 2026-01-31

**Focus**: Neutrino masses from the octonion sector (blind prediction)
**Topic**: `topics/` (new: neutrino sector, crosses particles/mixing angles)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S165 (Gap G2 closed, counting metric = HS)

## Outcome

First framework investigation of neutrino masses. Produced a structural theorem (Fano plane generation coupling = 4×I₃) and five blind predictions for the neutrino sector. The mass-squared ratio R₃₁ = Δm²₃₁/Δm²₂₁ = 33 = Im_H × n_c matches NuFIT 5.2 data to 1.7% (0.6σ). The structural finding is theorem-level: generation symmetry is algebraically exact, so mass ratios require dynamics. The prediction R₃₁ = 33 is [CONJECTURE], motivated by the PMNS pattern (sin²θ₁₂ = 10/33), not derived.

## Key Findings

### 1. Fano plane generation coupling is degenerate [THEOREM]

The coupling matrix for the three Im_H generations (i,j,k quaternion units) through the Im_O complement ({e₄,e₅,e₆,e₇}) is:

C_ij = Σ_{k∈comp} Σ_l f_{ikl} f_{jkl} = 4 × I₃

The full coupling (all Im_O) gives 6 × I₃ (= Killing form restriction). Associator norms are also generation-symmetric (16 per generation). G₂ transitivity makes all imaginary octonion units equivalent.

**Consequence**: Mass ratios CANNOT be derived from the division algebra structure alone. The generation symmetry is exact at the algebraic level. Breaking requires crystallization dynamics.

### 2. Mass-squared ratio R₃₁ = 33 = Im_H × n_c [CONJECTURE]

Predicted: R₃₁ = Δm²₃₁/Δm²₂₁ = Im_H × n_c = 3 × 11 = 33
Measured: 33.58 ± 0.93 (NuFIT 5.2, NO)
Error: 1.7%, 0.62σ

Equivalently: R₃₂ = H × O = 4 × 8 = 32 (measured 32.58, 1.8%, 0.64σ)
Consistency: R₃₁ = R₃₂ + 1 ✓

Connection: 33 is the denominator of sin²θ₁₂ = 10/33 (solar mixing angle).

### 3. Five neutrino predictions locked (P-017 to P-021) [CONJECTURE]

| ID | Observable | Predicted | Status |
|----|-----------|-----------|--------|
| P-017 | Mass ordering | Normal | Consistent (~2.5σ) |
| P-018 | R₃₁ | 33 | 0.6σ (1.7%) |
| P-019 | R₃₂ | 32 | 0.6σ (1.8%) |
| P-020 | m₁ | 0 | Consistent |
| P-021 | m_ee | [1.4, 3.7] meV | Below sensitivity |

### 4. Derived: mass sum Σ ≈ 58.5 meV [DERIVATION from P-018/020 + import]

With m₁ = 0, R₃₁ = 33, and Δm²₂₁ = 7.53×10⁻⁵ eV² [A-IMPORT]:
- m₂ = 8.7 meV, m₃ = 49.8 meV
- Σ = 58.5 meV (within Planck bound 120 meV and DESI+CMB bound 72 meV)

### 5. Neutrino Koide parameter Q_ν ≈ 0.585 [DERIVATION from P-018/020]

Q_ν = (1 + √33)/(1 + 33^{1/4})² = 0.5845
Close to 7/12 = Im_O/(n_d × Im_H) = 0.5833 (0.21% off)
Differs from charged lepton Q = 2/3 by 14%.

## Adversarial Assessment

**Individually NOT significant**: p ~ 12.5% for matching a DA integer within 2% of the measured ratio. Only 3 distinct DA expressions (products/sums of 2 building blocks) exist in [25,40]: 28, 32, 33.

**Collectively suggestive**: R₃₁ = 33 shares the same algebraic quantity (Im_H × n_c) as sin²θ₁₂ = 10/33. The PMNS pattern now includes:
- 3 mixing angles (4/7, 10/33, 1/44)
- 1 mass-squared ratio (33)
All using the framework's division algebra dimensions.

**HRS = 2** (MODERATE RISK). Key risk: LLM knows neutrino data. Key mitigation: structural analysis done first (Fano plane theorem is independent of predictions).

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Derive R₃₁ = 33 from crystallization dynamics**: The algebraic structure can't do it (C = 4I₃). What property of the crystallization potential breaks the generation symmetry to give eigenvalue ratio 33?
2. **Neutrino Koide**: Is Q_ν = 7/12 exact? If so, what does Im_O/(n_d × Im_H) mean for the mass formula?
3. **Absolute mass scale**: Can the seesaw scale M_R be a framework quantity? The geometric mean √(v_EW × M_Pl) ≈ 5.5×10¹⁰ GeV is suggestively close to the required M_R ≈ 6.3×10¹⁰ GeV.
4. **PMNS CP phase**: δ_PMNS = π×19/14 needs revisiting with NuFIT 6.0 (δ consistent with π at 1σ for NO). Is this prediction at risk?

## Key Context for Next Session

The neutrino sector now has 5 locked predictions (P-017 to P-021). The most significant finding is structural: the Fano plane coupling matrix is exactly 4×I₃ (complement) and 6×I₃ (full), proving that the octonion algebra cannot break generation symmetry. This is a theorem-level result regardless of whether the mass predictions hold. The mass-squared ratio R₃₁ = 33 = Im_H × n_c matches data to 1.7% but is individually not significant. Its connection to sin²θ₁₂ = 10/33 (same denominator) is the most interesting aspect — it suggests the "33" is a fundamental scale of the solar neutrino sector. The Q_ν ≈ 7/12 near-match is intriguing but unconfirmed.
