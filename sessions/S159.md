# Session 159 — S_2=29 Derivation + Correction Terms Search

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Focus**: Tasks B/D/E from S155 continuation: derive S_2=29, find correction terms, check GUT traces
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/alpha/multi_coupling_tilt_angles.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S155 (running test), S153 (induced mechanism), S158 (GUT traces)
**Next**: Physical mechanism for sub-percent weak/strong coupling predictions, or new high-impact direction

---

## Outcome

Three continuation tasks from S155 completed. Two new findings (17, 20) added to multi_coupling_tilt_angles.md. Three open questions resolved. Two verification scripts, 32/32 PASS total.

## Key Findings

### Task B: S_2 = 29 from Complex Bridge Principle (Finding 17)

The 29 SU(2)-charged modes out of 137 are: H_pure(9) + CH_cross(6) + CO_cross(14) = 29.

**Physical principle**: SU(2) charge requires coupling through the complex structure F=C. Modes that touch Im_C (the C-bridge) carry weak charge; modes that bypass it (HO_cross, defect, O_pure) do not.

**Algebraic formula**: S_2 = Im_H^2 + 2*Im_C*(Im_H + Im_O) = 9 + 6 + 14 = 29

Five hypotheses tested; only the Complex Bridge hypothesis gives exactly 29. S_3 = O = 8 does NOT follow from the same principle (different mechanism).

**Verification**: `s2_29_derivation.py` — 16/16 PASS

### Task D: Correction Terms NOT Analogous to 4/111 (Finding 20)

Systematic search for framework expressions correcting the leading-order predictions 1/alpha_2 = 30 and 1/alpha_s = 8.

**Key result**: The 4/111 = n_d/Phi_6(n_c) correction for alpha_EM is UNIQUE:
- alpha_EM: correction is 0.026% of leading, B=n_d (simplest), 0.3 ppm
- alpha_2: correction is 1.4% of leading, B=-47 (compound expression), 244 ppm
- alpha_s: correction is 6.0% of leading, B=+53 (framework prime), 342 ppm

HRS = 5 for the non-EM corrections. The large correction/leading ratios and the abundance of framework expressions matching the search space mean these are likely numerology.

**Notable**: 1/alpha_s = 17/C = 17/2 = 8.5 gives 0.30% without invoking Phi_6.

**Verification**: `correction_terms_alpha2_alphas.py` — 16/16 PASS

### Task E: GUT Traces (Already Done by S158)

Finding 16 in the investigation file documents the full GUT trace analysis. The trace formula gives 1/2, 6/13, or 3/8 — never 28/121. CLOSED as a mechanism. Script: gut_trace_weinberg.py — 20/20 PASS.

- `verification/sympy/s2_29_derivation.py` — NEW, 16/16 PASS
- `verification/sympy/correction_terms_alpha2_alphas.py` — NEW, 16/16 PASS
- `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` — Session registered and deregistered

## Open Questions Resolved

- Q2: 1/alpha_2 = 30 correction? → Phi_6 correction exists but NOT analogous (HRS=5)
- Q3: 1/alpha_s = O correction? → 8 + 53/111 at 342 ppm, but 6% of leading
- Q7: 28/121 correction? → 843 ppm likely IS the inherent precision
