# Session 161 — 2026-01-30

**Focus**: Collider data vs crystallization — planning session
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE (retroactive stub — session file was never written)
**Previous**: S160 (Weinberg scheme + gap + strong coupling)
**Next**: S163 (Collider dynamics mechanisms)

## Note

This session file was reconstructed from `sessions/INDEX.md` references during the Session 176 documentation audit. The original session file was never created. Session 162 also has no record — it either didn't occur or was a continuation that produced no distinct output.

## Outcome

Planning session: designed 5-phase investigation plan for collider data vs crystallization framework.

## Key Findings

1. **5-phase plan created** for systematically testing crystallization predictions against collider data
2. **10 investigation items** identified across the phases
3. **6 conjectures** formulated from collider data patterns

## Context

This session set up the work that was executed in S163 (dynamics mechanisms), S164 (single-photon tilt), S166 (Higgs BRs), S168 (eigenvalue selection), and subsequent sessions through S175 (EWSB).
