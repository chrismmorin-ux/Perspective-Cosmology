# Session S266: Alpha Radiative Gap -- Tree->Dressed Paradigm + C = 24/11

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Test tree->dressed paradigm across all predictions; investigate C ~ 24/11 coefficient
**Topic**: Alpha / constants / meta
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S262 (alpha radiative gap discovery), S258 (CONJ-A3 proven)

## Outcome

**Two major results**: (1) The tree->dressed paradigm passes a systematic test across ALL framework predictions (12/12 PASS). Prediction gaps organize into three cleanly separated bands matching QFT loop hierarchy: Band A (one-loop, 184-1619 ppm), Band B (two-loop, 1.5-4.2 ppm), Band C (sub-ppm, 0.06-0.27). (2) C = 24/11 = 2(n_c+1)/n_c reduces the alpha residual to 0.0002 ppm (~1.5 sigma from CODATA, 99x better than C = 2). Physical interpretation: 24 = colored pNGBs in SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) coset.

## Key Findings

1. **[DERIVATION] Tree->dressed paradigm: 12/12 PASS**: Framework gaps form three cleanly separated bands with NO overlap. Band classification matches QFT expectations: EW mass scales in Band A (one-loop), on-shell/lepton ratios in Band B (two-loop), fundamental coupling + QCD ratio in Band C (sub-ppm). Gap hierarchy spans 28,000x.

2. **[DERIVATION] Effective loop order is continuous**: n = 1.06 (m_Z) through 1.42 (z_rec) for Band A; n = 2.04 (cos theta_W, m_mu/m_e) through 2.21 (v/m_p) for Band B; n = 2.49 (1/alpha) through 2.75 (m_p/m_e) for Band C. No anomalous outliers.

3. **[CONJECTURE] C = 24/11 gives 0.0002 ppm residual**: The self-consistent equation 1/alpha + (24/11)*alpha^2/pi = 15211/111 yields 1/alpha = 137.035999053, just 3.1e-8 from CODATA. This is 99x better than C = 2 (which gives 0.022 ppm).

4. **[CONJECTURE] 24 = colored pNGBs**: In SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7), there are 28 Goldstone bosons. Subtracting 4 for the Higgs doublet gives 24 colored pNGBs. So C = (colored pNGBs)/n_c. Also 24 = 2 * dim(SM gauge) = 4! = dim(SU(5)).

5. **[DERIVATION] 12 = n_c + 1 has triple identification**: dim(SM gauge group) = 1+3+8 = 12, dim(H)+dim(O) = 4+8 = 12, and CCP pipeline endpoint 121->55->18->12.

6. **[CONJECTURE] Decomposition C = dim(C) * (1 + 1/n_c)**: Leading term = 2 (universal, complex structure). Sub-leading = 2/n_c (crystal-specific). Natural 1/n_c expansion, NOT a large-N limit.

7. **[DERIVATION] Sign pattern consistent**: Mass scales undershoot (radiative corrections increase masses). sin^2 overshoots (UV > IR under RG). 1/alpha overshoots (tree > dressed). All physically correct.

## Open Questions

1. **EQ-039 (updated)**: Derive C = 24/11 from composite sector loop calculation. The colored pNGB interpretation provides a specific path: compute the two-loop photon self-energy in the SO(11) composite model.
2. **sin^2 one-loop coefficient**: Can the one-loop correction from f to M_Z be computed from the composite sector particle content? Would give a PREDICTION.
3. **m_p/m_e anomaly**: Why is the proton/electron mass ratio so much more precise (0.06 ppm, Band C) than other mass ratios? Non-perturbative QCD exactness?
4. **Predict a new quantity**: Use the loop hierarchy to predict a correction that hasn't been measured. Strongest test of the paradigm.
5. **167321 mod 111 = 44**: In the cubic with C = 24/11, the coefficient 15211*11/111 = 1507 + 44/111. The remainder 44 = 4*11 = n_d * n_c. Coincidence or structure?

## Key Context for Next Session

The tree->dressed paradigm is now established as a systematic pattern (not just a single-number observation). All framework predictions organize into three bands matching one-loop, two-loop, and higher-order QFT corrections. The band classification correlates with quantity type (mass scales vs dimensionless ratios vs q=0 couplings), exactly as QFT predicts.

C = 24/11 = 2(n_c+1)/n_c = (colored pNGBs)/n_c gives alpha to 0.0002 ppm -- essentially matching CODATA to the measurement precision (1.5 sigma). The decomposition C = dim(C) * (1 + 1/n_c) is a natural expansion in 1/n_c.

The highest-value next step is deriving C = 24/11 from a two-loop calculation in the composite sector. The colored pNGB interpretation provides a specific Feynman diagram to compute. A secondary high-value direction is predicting the sin^2(theta_W) one-loop correction coefficient from the composite particle content.
