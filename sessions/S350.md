# Session S350: Launch C1b -- Interpretive Companion v1.0, Chunk 3

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Write Interpretive Companion v1.0 Chunk 3 (Sections 9-12: Part III)
**Parallel**: S349 (website W5/W8)

---

## Outcome

**C1b Chunk 3 COMPLETE.** Part III: Algebraic Structure (Sections 9-12) written into `PC_INTERPRETIVE_COMPANION.md`. Document now at 1219 lines (up from 852). ~367 new lines.

## Key Findings

### What Was Written

| Component | Lines | Content |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Part III header | ~8 | Introduction to algebraic consequences, no new [A-PHYSICAL] IRAs |
| Section 9 | ~70 | What the Crystal Knows: End(V)=121, four-block decomposition, nine-block CCP refinement, Aut_alg = {1}xSO(3)xG_2 |
| Section 10 | ~78 | How Gauge Forces Emerge: pipeline 121->55->27->18->12, SM gauge algebra u(1)+su(2)+su(3), electroweak split, uniqueness |
| Section 11 | ~84 | What Matter Looks Like: interface hypothesis, 15=R+C+H+O, hypercharge from Im_H=3, anomaly cancellation automatic |
| Section 12 | ~120 | Why Three Generations: Hom decomposition 28=7+3x7, Hurwitz rigidity, SO(3) generation symmetry, G_2->SU(3) branching, CKM/PMNS from SO(3)->SO(2), open flavor problems |
| Derivation chain | ~8 | Part III summary: CCP -> End(V)=121 -> pipeline -> gauge algebra + 3 generations |

### Design Decisions

1. **No new [A-PHYSICAL] IRAs** -- Part III uses only axioms, [I-MATH], and established IRA-06/IRA-07
2. **Section 11 combines math Secs 11+12** -- the companion reorganizes to focus interpretation on "what matter looks like" rather than strict math-paper sequencing
3. **Fermion content flagged at [DERIVATION] level** -- 15 = R+C+H+O is exact count, but structural assignment sketch-level. Interface hypothesis honestly caveated
4. **Hypercharge derivation referenced** -- all 5 values from Im_H=3, verified by `hypercharge_derivation.py`
5. **Flavor physics honestly marked [OPEN]** -- mass hierarchy, CKM/PMNS angles, CP violation all NOT derived
6. **Section 12 includes structural identity** -- 21 = dim(so(7)) from Cayley-Dickson, not coincidence
7. **Two [A-IMPORT] values in Section 11** -- charge integrality, Gell-Mann-Nishijima relation

### Chunk Plan Progress

| Chunk | Sections | Status | Lines |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| **1** | Frontmatter + 1-4 | **COMPLETE (S345)** | 456 |
| **2** | 5-8 | **COMPLETE (S348)** | ~395 |
| **3** | 9-12 | **COMPLETE (S350)** | ~367 |
| 4 | 13-16 | NOT STARTED | ~500 est |
| 5 | 17-20 | NOT STARTED | ~400 est |
| 6 | Appendices + review | NOT STARTED | ~350 est |

## Scripts

No new verification scripts (companion is interpretive, not computational).

## Open Questions

- Chunk 4 (Sections 13-16) covers Part IV: Numerical Consequences (democratic counting, Weinberg angle, alpha derivation, Higgs mass)
- Section 14 (alpha) is the most technically involved -- the three-band structure (A/B/C) and tree-to-dressed machinery
- Chunk 4 will require careful referencing of alpha derivation chain and verification scripts

## Key Context for Next Session

Chunk 4 covers Part IV: Numerical Consequences. Key sources:
- Math paper Sections 13-16 (democratic counting, Weinberg angle, alpha, Higgs)
- `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`, `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
- `framework/investigations/alpha/ALPHA_DERIVATION_MASTER.md`
- S344 (CCWZ Phase 3, D_3=1), S347 (D_3 derivation attempt)

Two [A-IMPORT] values will enter in Part IV: the identification of kappa with a coupling constant norm (IRA-01, now definitional) and |Pi| scale (IRA-11).
