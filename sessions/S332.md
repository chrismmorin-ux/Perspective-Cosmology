# Session S332: Launch Phase 1 — FOR_SKEPTICS v2.0

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Rewrite FOR_SKEPTICS.md with Red Team v3.0 integration; update LAUNCH_PLAN.md
**Topic**: Launch preparation
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S330 (Red Team v3.0), S327 (FOR_SKEPTICS v1.0)

---

## Outcome

Rewrote `launch/content/FOR_SKEPTICS.md` from v1.0 to v2.0, deeply integrating findings from Red Team v3.0 (`registry/RED_TEAM_SUMMARY_V3.md`). Updated `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` to replace all stale 20-35% references with 25-40%, update script counts (690->713), and refresh Appendix B key numbers.

## Key Changes in FOR_SKEPTICS v2.0

1. **Red Team v3.0 probability table**: Shows evolution 15-30% -> 20-35% -> 25-40% across three reviews with key drivers
2. **"What Has Improved" section (NEW)**: Before/after table covering IRA reduction, alpha chain, Yang-Mills, DM sector, tree-to-dressed, CKM, colored pNGB. Explains tree-to-dressed significance for skeptics
3. **Dark matter section (NEW)**: Complete DM sector (mass, coupling, stability, density) with experimental implications and Red Team NEW-6 objection pre-empted
4. **Colored pNGB section (NEW)**: P-022 at ~1.76 TeV, HL-LHC testable
5. **Three new Red Team criticisms surfaced**: NEW-7 (IRA semantic), NEW-8 (corrections fragility), Criticism 5 (CCP retrofitting) — all in "Hardest Objection" section
6. **Monte Carlo gap noted**: S170 hasn't been re-run with expanded prediction set — honest acknowledgment
7. **LLM Challenge all three versions**: v1 (3/4 SUCCESS), v2 (15/18 PASS), v3 (informative failure)
8. **Alpha chain zero conjectures**: Highlighted in "3 formulas" section
9. **Omega_m derivation**: Added S293 equipartition explanation
10. **Retractions documented**: S291, S319, S320 mentioned alongside 14 failures
11. **Belle II added** to experimental tests table (Band A test)
12. **Summary table expanded**: Added "Sub-ppm predictions systematic?" and "Near-term tests?" rows

## LAUNCH_PLAN.md Updates

- 20-35% -> 25-40% in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 4.3, 8, Decision Log, Appendix B
- 690 -> 713 scripts throughout (anti-crackpot assets, email template, Twitter thread, HN title, AI disclosure)
- Appendix B: Added retractions (3), registered predictions (P-001 through P-022), updated sessions (330+), noted 0 conjectural IRAs
- C4 status: COMPLETE with S327, S332
- Section 3.4: Status updated to COMPLETE (v2.0, S332), context ref -> RED_TEAM_SUMMARY_V3
- Section 3.5: Added S330 changes (Red Team v3.0, CKM, colored pNGB)
- Section 3.3 outline: Updated "No CKM" -> "CKM mechanism [DERIVATION] but mixing angles incomplete"
- Session 12: Added S332 entry

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `launch/content/FOR_SKEPTICS.md` | **Rewritten** v1.0 -> v2.0 (253 -> 327 lines) |
| `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` | **Updated** (~20 edits: probability, script counts, Appendix B, C4 status, session history) |
| `sessions/S332.md` | **Created** |
| `sessions/INDEX.md` | **Updated** |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | **Updated** (registered + deregistered) |

## Open Questions

1. **Monte Carlo re-run**: The S170 Monte Carlo with expanded prediction set and sub-ppm test is the highest-ROI statistical analysis not yet done. Should be prioritized.
2. **LLM Challenge v4**: Needed with current-generation models (Claude 4.5, GPT-4.5, Gemini Ultra). Not started.
3. **C1a (Math Foundations v1.0)**: The intellectual backbone. Most important remaining Phase 1 deliverable.

## Key Context for Next Session

FOR_SKEPTICS.md v2.0 is ready for author review. LAUNCH_PLAN.md is consistent with Red Team v3.0. Next Phase 1 priority is C1a (Mathematical Foundations v1.0) or C2 (AI Methodology). The FOR_SKEPTICS page now properly integrates all S258-S330 advances and preempts the 3 new Red Team criticisms.
