# Session S345: Launch C1b — Interpretive Companion v1.0, Chunk 1

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Write Interpretive Companion v1.0 Chunk 1 (Frontmatter + Sections 1-4)
**Parallel**: S346 (Website & Interactive UI)

---

## Outcome

**C1b Chunk 1 COMPLETE.** Full rewrite of `PC_INTERPRETIVE_COMPANION.md` Part I (456 lines). Replaces entire v0.2 draft with new v1.0-chunk1 structure mirroring the math paper section-by-section.

## Key Findings

### What Was Written

| Component | Lines | Content |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Frontmatter | ~78 | Key refs, how to read, epistemic conventions, preface |
| Section 1 | ~87 | Why These Axioms: perspective hypothesis, CCP physical reading, what axioms don't assume |
| Section 2 | ~80 | Why Division Algebras: information conservation, 4 algebras as forces, path independence, historical context |
| Section 3 | ~88 | Why 11, 4, C: forced dimensions as spacetime, hidden dimensions, complex QM |
| Section 4 | ~87 | Number-Theoretic Backbone: Gaussian norm partition, bridge prime 137, cyclotomic structure, Monte Carlo warning |
| Revision history | ~16 | Version tracking |

### Design Decisions

1. **Every [A-PHYSICAL] identification explicitly flagged** — the reader always knows where math becomes physics
2. **"Assumptions Entering" table per section** — cumulative assumption tracking
3. **"What Would Falsify" per section** — concrete falsification criteria
4. **Derivation chains in [A]/[I]/[D] notation** — traceable from axiom to claim
5. **Monte Carlo warning in Section 4** — honest about building block non-specialness
6. **Historical context in Section 2** — acknowledges Furey, Dixon, Baez, Boyle-Farnsworth
7. **No proofs duplicated** — references math paper theorems by number only

### Chunk Plan for Full C1b

| Chunk | Sections | Status | Est. Lines |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| **1** | Frontmatter + 1-4 | **COMPLETE (S345)** | 456 |
| 2 | 5-8 | NOT STARTED | ~400 |
| 3 | 9-12 | NOT STARTED | ~450 |
| 4 | 13-16 | NOT STARTED | ~500 |
| 5 | 17-20 | NOT STARTED | ~400 |
| 6 | Appendices + review | NOT STARTED | ~350 |

## Scripts

No new verification scripts (companion is interpretive, not computational).

## Open Questions

- Chunk 2 will need careful treatment of IRA-06 (crystallization = SSB) and IRA-07 (adjacency = time) as [A-PHYSICAL, Weinberg-forced]
- Section 8 (Lorentz signature) needs to connect to both THM_04AE and the experimental causal structure
- How much detail on the Grassmannian topology (Section 5) is appropriate for physicists?

## Key Context for Next Session

Chunk 2 covers Part II: Geometric Consequences (Sections 5-8). Key sources:
- Math paper Sections 5-8 (lines 375-720)
- `IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md` IRA-06 and IRA-07 entries
- S291 (Grassmannian topology correction)
- S286 (CONJ-B1 FFT proof)

The two surviving [A-PHYSICAL] IRAs (IRA-06, IRA-07) both enter in Part II. These need careful Weinberg-criterion treatment: all defining properties present, no alternatives, no inconsistencies -- but formally still [A-PHYSICAL] because "math = physics" is the foundational meta-assumption of mathematical physics.
