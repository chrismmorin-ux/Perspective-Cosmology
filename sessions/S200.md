# Session 200 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: Evaluation map chain — gauge breaking from hidden space
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/meta/evaluation_map_foundations.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S197 (eval map: spectral metric, C*-algebra QM), S199 (CMB + CC sign)

---

## Outcome

Formalized the gauge breaking chain from the evaluation map perspective. Two independent routes (energetic via THM_0487, algebraic via eval map kernel) converge on SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1). Documented the continuous s gap as irreducible and Herm(2) = spacetime as the weakest link. All three S197 open items addressed.

## Key Findings

1. **Two-route gauge convergence** [DERIVATION]: The eval map kernel decomposition (Hom blocks: 16+28+28+49=121) independently derives the SM gauge group, converging with THM_0487's Landau breaking chain. Hidden: so(7) → G_2 → SU(3). Defect with F=C: U(2) = SU(2)×U(1). Same answer, different mechanisms.

2. **Defect gauge from F=C** [DERIVATION]: With F=C (THM_0485), defect W=R^4 becomes W_C=C^2 with unitary group U(2)=SU(2)×U(1). This provides SU(2)_L (inner automorphisms of M_2(C)) and U(1)_Y (center). F=C does EWSB's work in the eval map route — no separate Higgs mechanism needed for gauge selection.

3. **44 = n_d × n_c identity** [CONJECTURE]: Total broken generators including EWSB (41+3=44) equals the visible eval map operators (n_d × n_c = 4×11=44). Specific to (11,4) with SM gauge group — not a general identity. Interesting but not deeply significant.

4. **Continuous s gap: IRREDUCIBLE** [DOCUMENTED]: The eval map provides kinematics (what structures exist) but not dynamics (which Hamiltonian, what masses). The continuous parameter s in THM_0493 reflects this fundamental distinction. Resolution requires dynamical input from AXM_0117, THM_0487, THM_0494.

5. **Herm(2) = spacetime: weakest link** [A-PHYSICAL]: The identification remains a Layer 2 correspondence. The eval map gives an algebra (not a manifold). Three strengthening paths identified: Dirac operator from crystallization, Herm(2) parametrizes perspective equivalences, Kadison duality.

## Files Created
- `verification/sympy/gauge_chain_convergence.py` — Two-route gauge convergence verification

## Files Modified
- `framework/investigations/meta/evaluation_map_foundations.md` — Added gauge chain section, updated open questions, verification table, session history

## Open Questions

1. **Perspective uniqueness** (C4 equivariance): All same-rank perspectives are equivalent — which one IS physics?
2. **Herm(2) = spacetime**: Can Connes spectral geometry derive this from M_2(C)?
3. **Representation content**: What SM representations live in each Hom block? [CONJECTURE]
4. **44 identity**: Is the broken generators = visible operators identity meaningful or coincidental?

## Key Context for Next Session

The evaluation map chain is now comprehensive:
```
AXM_0115 -> THM_04AB (n_c=11)
  -> THM_04AC (perspectives exist, CANONICAL)
  -> THM_04AD (k=4, DERIVATION)
  -> THM_04AE (Lorentz (1,3), spectral metric, DERIVATION)
  -> C*-algebra route to QM (DERIVATION)
  -> Gauge chain: SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) from two routes (DERIVATION)
  -> Continuous s gap: irreducible from kinematics (DOCUMENTED)
  -> Herm(2) = spacetime: A-PHYSICAL (DOCUMENTED)
```

Total verification: 15 scripts, ~100 tests, all PASS.

Remaining work on this topic is blocked on external mathematical input (spectral geometry for Herm(2), dynamics for s gap). The eval map chain is as complete as it can be from the current axiom base.

Next actionable topics from INDEX.md:
- **Recursive gap tower** (S196): Derive rank-4 at meta-levels, falsifiability
- **Phase 7 statistics**: Cross-framework statistical assessment
- **Derive mass scale f**: From gravity audit
