# Session S273: Planck's Constant -- Vol~chi Universality + Moment Map

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Two open threads from S267 on h investigation
**Topic**: Planck's constant / Grassmannian geometry
**Previous**: S267 (metric normalization, volume defect)
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Outcome

Resolved two of four open threads from S267. Thread #2 (Vol~chi universality): the 0.95% near-miss is NOT universal -- it arises from a zero-crossing where (4,11) is the unique integer lattice point closest to the zero-locus. Thread #3 (G_2 moment map): computed explicitly, mu is surjective onto g_2*, canonical split has mu=0, all basis 2-forms show 1/3:2/3 (associative:g_2) decomposition.

## Key Findings

1. **[THEOREM] Vol~chi zero-crossing**: The function f(k,n) = Vol(Gr(k,n;R))/C(n,k) - 1 changes sign near (4,11). Zero locations: n* = 10.994 (at k=4), k* = 3.956 (at n=11). Out of 49 Grassmannians checked, only (4,11) is within 10% of C(n,k). Upgrades S267 observation.

2. **[THEOREM] Pi cancellation is UNIVERSAL**: Vol(Gr(k,n;R))/(2pi)^{dim/2} is rational for ALL even-dimensional real Grassmannians (38/38). Not specific to (4,11).

3. **[THEOREM] G_2 moment map surjective**: mu: Gr(4,11) -> g_2* has full rank 14. Every element of g_2 is realizable as the non-associativity of some perspective configuration.

4. **[THEOREM] mu(0) = 0**: The canonical split R^4 + R^7 is the unique G_2-neutral fixed point.

5. **[THEOREM] Universal 1/3:2/3 decomposition**: ALL 21 basis 2-forms in Lambda^2(R^7) have identical decomposition: 1/3 in the 7-rep (associative), 2/3 in g_2 (non-associative). Follows from Fano plane being a (7,3,1)-design.

6. **[THEOREM] C*C = 6 * I_7**: The contraction metric for the associative 3-form phi is 6 times the identity.

7. **[DERIVATION] Physical interpretation**: mu measures non-associativity of perspective configurations. mu=0 iff the spreading of J_I into R^7 is purely Fano-compatible. The spacetime subspace R^4 = H is the unique G_2-neutral point.

## Open Questions

1. **EQ-038: Schubert calculus** (HARD): Compute the ratio alpha = omega_Killing / omega_integral for Gr(4,11;R). This determines the exact level-1 state count for geometric quantization.

2. **EQ-011: V_0 connection** (LOW): The Vol(Gr) factorization may connect to the inflationary amplitude. Both involve Gr(4,11) geometry.

3. **Mu=0 locus structure**: What is the topology of {A in Hom(R^4, R^7) : mu(A) = 0}? These are the "purely associative" configurations. How does this connect to the physical spectrum?

## Key Context for Next Session

The h investigation is now CANONICAL with **8 paths** explored (up from 7 in S267) and 13/13 PASS across 2 new scripts (total 8 scripts, ~80 tests). Open questions #2 and #4 from S267 are RESOLVED. The two remaining threads are EQ-038 (Schubert calculus, HARD) and EQ-011 (V_0 inflationary connection, LOW). The mu=0 locus structure is a new question generated this session.

The physical picture: Gr(4,11;R) is the unique real Grassmannian where quantization nearly matches its complex counterpart (zero-crossing). The G_2 moment map measures non-associativity; the canonical spacetime split is G_2-neutral; the moment map is surjective, meaning the full g_2 is dynamically accessible.
