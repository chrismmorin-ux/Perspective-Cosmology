## Outcome

Three investigations completed. (1) The Egyptian fraction 1/2+1/3+1/7=41/42 has a representation-theoretic interpretation: over common denominator 42=LCM(dim_C, Im_H, Im_O), the numerators are 21=dim(so(7)), 14=dim(G_2), 6=dim(so(4)) -- the three structural symmetry groups of the framework. This follows from Cayley-Dickson identities. The cross-algebraic pattern (C measures O-rotations, H measures O-automorphisms, O measures H-rotations) is a corollary. (2) The beta function ladder b_0={11,9,7,5,3,1} is DEBUNKED as an independent finding: it's just odd numbers from 11 to 1, a repackaging of EQ-008. (3) Sylvester and Cayley-Dickson agree at {3,7} but diverge at {15 vs 43}. The branching equation Phi_6(x)=2x+1 has unique solution x=3=Im_H, making H the branching point. The difference 43-15=28=N_Goldstone is structural.

## Key Findings

1. **Egyptian fraction numerators = Lie algebra dimensions** [DERIVATION]: Over LCM denominator 42, the numerators 42/dim_C=21=dim(so(7)), 42/Im_H=14=dim(G_2), 42/Im_O=6=dim(so(4)). Follows from Cayley-Dickson identity Im_H=(Im_O-1)/2 and dim(G_2)=2*Im_O.

2. **Cross-algebraic pattern** [DERIVATION]: C's share (1/2) measures SO(7) (octonionic rotations), H's share (1/3) measures G_2 (octonionic automorphisms), O's share (1/7) measures SO(4) (spacetime rotations). Each algebra's share measures the symmetry of a DIFFERENT sector.

3. **42 = dim_R(so(7)_C)** [THEOREM]: The common denominator equals the real dimension of the complexified so(7) Lie algebra.

4. **Beta function ladder DEBUNKED** [OBSERVATION]: b_0={11,9,7,5,3,1} are just odd numbers from 11 to 1. The ladder is a repackaging of 11/3=n_c/Im_H (EQ-008). Identifications 9=Im_H^2 and 5=n_d+1 are ad hoc. Only b_0(0)=n_c and b_0(6)=Im_O carry structural weight.

5. **Phi_6/CD branching at Im_H** [DERIVATION]: Phi_6(x)=2x+1 iff x(x-3)=0, so x=0 or x=3=Im_H. H (quaternions) is the unique branching point where local (Cayley-Dickson) and global (Sylvester/Phi_6) recursions diverge.

6. **43 - 15 = 28 = N_Goldstone** [DERIVATION]: At the Hurwitz boundary, Sylvester minus CD equals the coset dimension. Algebraically: Im_O * 2*(Im_H-1) = Im_O * n_d = 28. Does NOT generalize (step 5 gives 1720).

7. **Phi_6(n) = n(n-1)+1** [THEOREM]: The cyclotomic polynomial counts off-diagonal endomorphisms of Im(A) plus 1 scalar.

8. **Q1-Q3 connection** [DERIVATION]: Phi_6(Im_O)-1 = Im_O*(Im_O-1) = 7*6 = 42 = Egyptian denominator. The 42 in both contexts is the SAME object, because Im_O-1 = 6 = dim_C*Im_H (Cayley-Dickson identity).

## Open Questions

1. **Graded decomposition formalization**: The 42=21+14+6+1 decomposition as so(7)+G_2+so(4)+R^1 -- is this a grading of some natural 42-dimensional object, or just a numerological partition? The complexified so(7) interpretation (42=dim_R(so(7)_C)) is clean but the grading doesn't match the complex structure.
2. **Branching point physical meaning**: H being the unique branching point of Phi_6 vs CD connects to associativity loss. Does this have a physical interpretation beyond "n_d=4 is special"?
3. **Off-diagonal endomorphism interpretation**: Phi_6(n)=n(n-1)+1 counts off-diagonal maps + identity. Is the "+1" the physical "scalar mode" that creates the Egyptian fraction remainder?

## Key Context for Next Session

Egyptian fraction 41/42 has representation-theoretic interpretation: numerators are dim(so(7))=21, dim(G_2)=14, dim(so(4))=6 [DERIVATION]. Cross-algebraic pattern follows from Cayley-Dickson. Beta ladder debunked (just odd numbers, repackaging EQ-008). Sylvester-CD branching at Im_H=3 [DERIVATION], with 43-15=28=N_Goldstone. Phi_6(n)=off-diagonal+1 connects Q1 and Q3 via 42=Phi_6(7)-1. 64/64 PASS (3 scripts). No propagation triggers.
