# Session 177 — 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Documentation audit — Phases 3-4 (derivations_summary + divergence_registry)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S176 (Phases 0-2: deprecation, quick fixes, falsification registry)
**Next**: S178+ (Phase 5: CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES, Phase 6: core issues)

---

## Outcome

Updated two major registry files to cover S143-S175 work. Added 6 new derivation sections and 8 new divergence entries, plus revised 2 existing entries with current results.

## Key Findings

1. **derivations_summary.md updated** (Phase 3): Added sections 1.29-1.34 covering multi-coupling/Weinberg angle (S151-S160), collider data validation (S163-S166), counting metric and Born rule (S165, S173), neutrino masses (S167), SM gauge group and EWSB (S168, S174-S175), and crystallization dynamics (S169-S172). Updated qualitative sections 2.1 (SM gauge) and 2.3 (EWSB) with S174-S175 results. Updated remaining gaps, unique predictions, key insights, and summary statistics. Total constants count: 63+.

2. **divergence_registry.md updated** (Phase 4): Revised D2 (sin²θ_W now structural derivation from Goldstone fraction, not just 2/9 pattern) and D5 (α now multi-layer Born rule derivation, not just crystal-defect interface). Added 8 new entries: D11 (SM gauge group from SO(11)), D12 (pNGB Higgs), D13 (Born rule uniqueness), D14 (hilltop inflation r=0.035), D15 (neutrino R₃₁=33), D16 (democratic counting vs RG), D17 (crystallization unification), D18 (QFT coefficients as algebra numbers). Total: 18 divergences, tiered by strength.

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `registry/derivations_summary.md` | +6 sections (1.29-1.34), updated sections 2.1, 2.3, 5, 6, 7, 8 |
| `registry/divergence_registry.md` | Updated D2, D5; added D11-D18; revised summary tiers |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | Session registered then deregistered |
| `sessions/INDEX.md` | S177 added to recent sessions |

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Phase 5**: `CLAIM_DEPENDENCIES.md` needs THM_0487-04A4 and DEF_02A3-02C4
2. **Phase 6**: Core issues — THM_0497 math error, 3 downgraded SKETCH theorems, 2 PROPOSED axioms

## Key Context

Pure documentation session — no new physics. Both derivations_summary and divergence_registry are now current through S175. The framework's strongest results are now properly documented: SM gauge group derivation (D11), EWSB mechanism (D12), Born rule uniqueness (D13), and the multi-layer alpha derivation (D5 updated). The divergence registry now clearly distinguishes Tier 1 results (testable, structural) from patterns and weak arguments.
