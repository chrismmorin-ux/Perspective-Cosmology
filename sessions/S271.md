**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Casimir identities, glueball spectrum, SU(N) systematics (continuation of S268)
**Topic**: Gauge theory / Yang-Mills
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S268 (Yang-Mills initial exploration)
**Next**: Glueball structural argument; EQ-041 (Landau coefficients); lattice monitoring

## Outcome

Extended S268 Yang-Mills investigation with 7 structural identities [DERIVATION] and 5 conjectural matches. Key finds: C_2(F)*C_2(A) = n_d (Casimir product = spacetime dimension), Im_H^2-1 = dim(O) unique among DA pairs, glueball spectrum m/sqrt(sigma) = {n_d, n_c/2, 2*Im_H, Im_O}, and SU(N) transition order systematics (6/6 lattice match). Four scripts, 57/57 PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **C_2(F)*C_2(A) = n_d = 4** [DERIVATION]: Product of fundamental and adjoint Casimirs equals spacetime dimension. Chain: (N_c^2-1)/2 = dim(O)/2 = dim(H) = n_d. Connects color interaction strength to spacetime via Cayley-Dickson doubling + Frobenius.

2. **dim(su(3)) = dim(O) = 8 is unique** [DERIVATION]: Im_H^2-1 = dim(O) holds only for the H->O pair among all DA steps. Proved: (2^k-1)^2-1 = 2^(k+1) iff k=2 (H). The number of gluons = octonionic dimension is structural, not coincidental.

3. **G_2 dimension chain** [DERIVATION]: SO(7)->G_2->SU(3)->U(1) with all dimensions and cosets = DA numbers: dim(G_2)=2*Im_O=14, G_2/SU(3)=Im_O-1=6=S^6, SO(7)/G_2=Im_O=7.

4. **Casimir scaling = Im_H^2/n_d = 9/4** [DERIVATION]: String tension ratio sigma_A/sigma_F in DA language.

5. **SU(N) transition orders 6/6 match** [DERIVATION]: SU(2) 2nd order (Z_2 forbids cubic), SU(3-7) 1st order (Z_N allows cubic). Im_H = n_d-1 makes SU(3) marginally sub-quartic.

6. **Glueball spectrum: m/sqrt(sigma) = {n_d, n_c/2, 2*Im_H, Im_O}** [CONJECTURE, HRS=6]: Four glueball states at {4, 5.5, 6, 7} * sqrt(sigma), within 1-5% of lattice. Excitation costs from 0++ base: {Im_H/dim_C, dim_C, Im_H} — all H-channel. Consecutive gaps: {3/2, 1/2, 1} = {Im_H/dim_C, 1/dim_C, dim_R}.

7. **T_c/sqrt(sigma) = Im_O/n_c = 7/11** [CONJECTURE, HRS=5]: Deconfinement temperature at 1.2% from lattice.

8. **24 triple identity: dim_C * n_d * Im_H = n_d! = 24** [DERIVATION]: Luscher coefficient 1/24 combines all three channels.

## Open Questions

1. **Glueball structural argument** (EQ-041 related): Can the quantum number -> DA expression mapping (spin-2 = Im_H/dim_C, parity = dim_C, exotic = Im_H) be DERIVED from SU(3) representation theory?
2. **Lattice precision monitoring**: Need <3% lattice uncertainties on all 4 glueball states to confirm or falsify the spectrum conjecture. The 1+- state (5.1% error) is the weakest match.
3. **T_c structural argument**: Can the deconfinement temperature ratio Im_O/n_c = 7/11 be derived from the Z_3 Landau potential?

## Key Context for Next Session

Session extended the Yang-Mills investigation from S268 with structural identities and quantitative predictions. The strongest new results are the Casimir product identity C_2(F)*C_2(A) = n_d (proven via Cayley-Dickson chain) and the uniqueness of Im_H^2-1 = dim(O). The glueball spectrum conjecture {n_d, n_c/2, 2*Im_H, Im_O} is striking but HRS=6 (ratio search with ~15 candidates and 4 targets). The additivity structure with H-channel excitation costs is the most promising path to a structural argument. Combined with S268: 82/82 PASS across 4 scripts.
