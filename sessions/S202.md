# Session 202 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: Phase 7 — Cross-framework statistical assessment
**Topic**: `framework/STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS_HONEST.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S201 (recursive gap tower), S200 (eval map), S199 (CMB/CC), S170 (Monte Carlo)

---

## Outcome

Completed Phase 7: consolidated all Phase 3-6 audit results into a cross-framework statistical assessment. 51 predictions cataloged with post-audit confidence grades. Overall framework grade: C+. 14 downgrades, 3 falsifications, 8 new derivations since S170. Blind P-value unchanged at ~2.5e-7. Updated probability: 15-25% genuine physics (narrowed from 15-30%).

## Key Findings

1. **51 predictions cataloged** [ASSESSMENT]: 19 genuinely derived (CANONICAL/DERIVATION/THEOREM), 17 conjecture/hybrid/partial, 9 blind, 15 structural, 3 falsified, 3 untested predictions. Post-audit inventory is comprehensive.

2. **Phase grades assigned**: QM (A), Eval map (B+), Recursive tower (A-), Particles (B-), Cosmology (C-), Gravity (D+). Overall C+. Pattern: structural derivations are genuine strengths; numerical formulas are mostly post-hoc.

3. **Falsifications are contained**: F-10 (CC wrong sign) is CRITICAL but isolated to dark energy mechanism. Does not propagate to gauge groups, QM, spacetime, alpha, or blind predictions. eta* and c_s falsifications are MODERATE and already documented.

4. **Blind P-value unchanged**: 3 falsifications were NOT blind predictions. The 9 blind predictions (P ~ 2.5e-7) remain the strongest statistical evidence. Monte Carlo still shows building blocks are NOT special.

5. **8 major derivation chains assessed**: 4 complete (QM, gauge, spacetime, tower), 2 partial (alpha, cosmology), 1 weak (masses), 1 broken (gravity/CC). Framework is structurally sound but numerically mixed.

6. **Updated probability 15-25%**: Narrowed from Red Team's 15-30%. QM strengthening and gauge convergence are positive. CC failure and numerical downgrades are negative. Net: approximately balanced.

7. **r = 0.035 is the decisive test**: CMB-S4 (~2028-2029) will measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio with sigma ~ 0.001. Confirmation would be the most significant evidence for the framework. Falsification would be devastating.

## Scripts

| Script | Tests | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `phase7_cross_framework_statistics.py` | 8 | 8 PASS |

## Files Created
- `verification/sympy/phase7_cross_framework_statistics.py` — Phase 7 cross-framework assessment (8/8 PASS)

## Files Modified
- `framework/STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS_HONEST.md` — Added Section 9: Phase 7 Update (post-audit)

## Open Questions

1. **LLM Challenge**: Would an independent LLM derive the same numbers? Addresses derivation-vs-discovery.
2. **CC resolution**: Can a correct-sign potential be found? Or is dark energy outside the framework's scope?
3. **Numerical mechanisms**: Can Step 5 (alpha) and mass formula main terms be derived rather than searched?

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 7 is COMPLETE. The framework's state is now fully documented:
```
Phases 3-6: ALL COMPLETE
  QM:         A  (CANONICAL, fully derived)
  Particles:  B- (structural [D], numerical [C])
  Cosmology:  C- (blind success, many gaps, 3 falsified)
  Gravity:    D+ (EFE [D], CC [F-10])
  Eval map:   B+ (two-route gauge convergence)
  Tower:      A- (meta-level ranks derived)

Statistical:
  Blind P-value:   2.5e-7 (unchanged)
  Monte Carlo:     0.80 (blocks not special)
  Falsifications:  3 (contained)
  Overall grade:   C+
  Probability:     15-25% genuine physics

Future tests:
  r = 0.035 (CMB-S4, 2028-2029) — decisive
  Neutrino ordering (JUNO, 2027)
  w = -1 (DESI, ongoing)
```

All 7 phases are now complete. Remaining work options:
- **Derive mass scale f** (from gravity audit S195)
- **Spectral geometry for Herm(2)** (from eval map S200)
- **Strengthen specific numerical chains** (Step 5, mass mechanisms)
- **LLM Challenge execution** (GPT-4, Gemini)
- **Write physicist summary** (QUICKSTART.md equivalent for external review)
