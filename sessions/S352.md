# Session S352: DM Mass Mechanism Investigation

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Investigate whether det(M) sets a gauge coupling (Hyp A) or density-dependent mass (Hyp B)
**Outcome**: Both hypotheses fail. Hyp A structurally impossible, Hyp B quantitatively too weak.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Hypothesis A: det(M) as gauge coupling [REJECTED, THEOREM]

SO(11) breaking chain fully accounted for:
- 55 generators total: 28 pNGBs + 27 unbroken
- Of 27 unbroken: 12 gauged (SM) + 15 global only
- NO residual dark gauge symmetry exists
- Would require new [A-IMPORT] (increases IRA count from 4 to 5)

### 2. Hypothesis B: density-dependent mass [QUANTITATIVE FAILURE, DERIVATION]

Full det expansion at democratic vacuum proven:
```
det(M) = c^4 + c^3*S_1 + c^2*S_2 + c*S_3 + S_4
```
For traceless fluctuations dl_i = h + xi_i (Tr(xi)=0):
- sigma_2 = 6h^2 - sum(xi^2)/2
- Density-dependent coupling: kappa = xi/(2c^2) ~ 1.66e-4
- 4 orders of magnitude too weak for galaxy-scale effects
- Non-perturbative 't Hooft analogy gives m ~ 2700 GeV (wrong scale)

### 3. New Theorems

- **sigma_2 traceless decomposition**: sigma_2(h+xi) = 6h^2 - sum(xi^2)/2 when Tr(xi)=0 [THEOREM]
- **det reduction by inhomogeneity**: Non-uniform fluctuations always reduce det(M) [DERIVATION]
- **kappa bound**: Framework coupling strength kappa = xi/(2c^2) ~ 10^-4, no free parameters [DERIVATION]

### 4. Observational Consistency

All constraints trivially satisfied (framework predicts CDM-like behavior):
- Bullet Cluster, equivalence principle, CMB/BAO, N_eff, BBN all consistent
- Framework does NOT address CDM small-scale crisis

### 4. Eigenvalue Landscape Theorems (new results)

Five mathematically significant structures proven on eigenvalue space of End(R^4):
- **AM-GM maximum** [THEOREM]: det maximized at democratic vacuum on Tr = const
- **Vandermonde repulsion** [THEOREM]: V = 0 at democracy, entropic force pushes apart. Dyson threefold way matches division algebras: R->beta=1, C->2, H->4
- **det = 0 phase boundary** [THEOREM]: distance c = 10 from vacuum, far away
- **Unique Morse critical point** [THEOREM]: log(det) has exactly 1 critical point (the democratic vacuum, Morse index 3). Mass topologically protected
- **RMT corrections** [DERIVATION]: <D_4> ~ 1 - 0.05% (GOE) or 1 - 0.013% (GSE). Tiny, calculable
- **Democracy index** [DERIVATION]: D_4 = det/(Tr/4)^4, natural order parameter. Maclaurin chain D_2 >= D_3 >= D_4

## Open Questions

1. **Carrier particle identity**: Still the genuine open problem. nu_R most promising.
2. **Whether det(M) = 5.11 GeV is an orphan prediction**: Mass formula structurally sound but mechanistically incomplete.
3. **CDM small-scale crisis**: Framework is silent on this. Would need SIDM or similar beyond current axioms.

## Key Context for Next Session

The DM sector investigation has converged on two levels:

**Mechanism investigation**: Both non-standard hypotheses (gauge coupling, density-dependent mass) fail. Hyp A structurally blocked (no dark gauge symmetry). Hyp B quantitatively too weak (kappa ~ 10^-4).

**Landscape analysis**: The eigenvalue space of End(R^4) has remarkably simple topology: one critical point (democratic vacuum), topologically protected, tiny RMT corrections. The math says: the framework predicts boring CDM with mass 5.11 GeV. No exotic behavior emerges naturally.

**New mathematical connections**: The Dyson threefold way (beta = 1,2,4 for GOE/GUE/GSE) matches R,C,H exactly. The quaternionic structure of spacetime gives strong eigenvalue repulsion (beta=4), stabilizing the democratic vacuum. The democracy index D_4 = det/(Tr/4)^4 is a natural order parameter. These connections are mathematically interesting in their own right [CONJECTURE: Dyson-division algebra correspondence].

**Carrier problem**: Morse theory confirms this is a particle physics question. The mass lives at the unique equilibrium. Most promising: nu_R with a Dirac mass set by det(M). Or accept as orphan prediction.
