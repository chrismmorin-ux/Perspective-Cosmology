# Session 239: Crystallization Catalog Expansion -- Phase 7 Batch 2

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog Phase 7 batch 2: quarkonia/glueballs, atomic structure, recombination/reionization, baryogenesis, high-energy astrophysics sub-catalogs
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S236 (Phase 7 batch 1)

---

## Outcome

Phase 7 batch 2 of the Crystallization Catalog expansion is complete. Five new sub-catalog files created: `quarkonia_and_glueballs.md` (4 processes: charmonium spectrum, bottomonium spectrum, glueball spectrum, exotic quarkonia), `atomic_structure.md` (4 processes: hydrogen, helium, positronium, Lamb shift), `recombination_and_reionization.md` (3 processes: hydrogen recombination, cosmic dawn/reionization, Saha equation), `baryogenesis.md` (4 processes: Sakharov conditions, EW baryogenesis, leptogenesis, baryon asymmetry eta), and `high_energy_astrophysics.md` (4 processes: AGN jets, UHE cosmic rays/GZK, gamma-ray bursts, blazars). C5, C7, C12, C13, C16 updated with sub-catalog cross-references. No new verification scripts needed. Catalog updated v3.7 -> v3.8 (58 scripts, 723 tests unchanged).

**Phase 7 is now COMPLETE.** All skeleton sub-catalogs from the README directory listing are populated.

## Key Findings

1. **Quarkonia: C_F = 4/3 is the framework content** [honest assessment]: 2/4 entries [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (charmonium, bottomonium spectra via Cornell potential C_F = 4/3 from N_c = 3), 2/4 [STANDARD-RELABELED] (glueball spectrum, exotic quarkonia). No quarkonium or glueball masses derived. Glueball existence requires non-abelian gauge (N_c >= 2), consistent with but not specific to N_c = 3.

2. **Atomic structure: alpha = 1/137 enters everywhere** [honest assessment]: 2/4 entries [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (hydrogen, positronium — both purely alpha-dependent), 2/4 [STANDARD-RELABELED] (helium, Lamb shift). Positronium is the purest alpha test (no hadronic complications). All framework content traces to the single identification alpha = 1/(n_d^2 + n_c^2). No energy levels, transition rates, or QED corrections derived.

3. **Recombination: alpha and N_nu consistency checks** [honest assessment]: 2/3 entries [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (hydrogen recombination, Saha equation — alpha enters binding energy and recombination coefficient; N_nu enters expansion rate), 1/3 [STANDARD-RELABELED] (reionization — entirely astrophysics-dependent). Recombination physics is well-understood standard cosmology.

4. **Baryogenesis: the weakest sub-catalog** [honest assessment]: 0/4 entries [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED], 4/4 [STANDARD-RELABELED]. The framework has no mechanism for the baryon asymmetry eta ~ 6 x 10^-10. The SO(11) spinor embedding structurally includes nu_R (relevant for leptogenesis) but provides no quantitative predictions. Composite Higgs xi = 4/121 might affect the EW phase transition strength but this is uncalculated. Baryogenesis remains a fundamental gap.

5. **High-energy astrophysics: entirely relabeled** [honest assessment]: 0/4 entries [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED], 4/4 [STANDARD-RELABELED]. AGN jets, UHECRs, GRBs, and blazars involve complex MHD and plasma physics that the framework does not address. Included for completeness and multi-channel classification.

6. **Sub-catalog system now at 25 files, 99 process entries** [catalog expansion]: With Phase 7 complete, the system covers decays (15 in 4 files), scattering (17 in 4 files), bound states (18 in 4 files), phase transitions (19 in 5 files), astrophysical (17 in 4 files), and cosmological (13 in 4 files).

## Scripts

No new scripts created. All entries reference existing verification:
- `hadron_mass_crystallization.py` (16/16 PASS) — C_F, color factors for quarkonia
- `alpha_enhanced_prediction.py` — alpha formula for atomic structure
- `phase_transition_crystallization.py` (16/16 PASS) — N_nu, alpha in recombination
- `astrophysical_crystallization.py` (12/12 PASS) — BH shadow, GRB energy scaling

## Open Questions

1. **DM mass formula discrepancy** (EQ-013): Carried from S234. m_e * n_c^2/n_d = 15.5 MeV, not 5.11 GeV. Needs investigation.
2. **CKM matrix derivation** (C10 gap): Critical missing piece for weak decay predictions. No progress this session.
3. **Baryogenesis mechanism** (C16 gap): Framework has no eta prediction. Composite Higgs EW phase transition strength uncalculated.
4. **Composite Higgs finite-T potential**: Could the framework's xi = 4/121 produce a first-order EW phase transition enabling EW baryogenesis? Requires calculation.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 7 is COMPLETE. The sub-catalog system now has 25 files with 99 process entries across 6 subdirectories. Catalog v3.8 (58 scripts, 723 tests, unchanged since no new scripts needed). The honesty tagging across all 99 entries shows the expected pattern: framework content is strongest where sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121, alpha = 1/137, or N_c = Im_H = 3 enter cross-sections/rates directly. Baryogenesis (C16) and high-energy astrophysics are the weakest areas (all [STANDARD-RELABELED]). The entire Phase 0-7 catalog expansion is now done.

**Recommended next**: Return to physics investigations (EQ-002 Om_m mechanism, EQ-006 top Yukawa, EQ-012 crossed Casimir coupling, EQ-003 alpha Step 5 mechanism). Or begin a new catalog phase (consolidation/quality review of all 99 entries).
