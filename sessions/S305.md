# Session S305: EQ-008 Four Remaining Investigation Directions

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: EQ-008 — Four remaining investigation directions for 11/3 = n_c/Im_H
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/gauge/running_couplings_crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S303 (denominator resolution), S296 (structural origin)
**Next**: New physics topic or Band A testable predictions (EQ-039)

---

## Outcome

Exhaustively investigated four remaining open directions from EQ-008. All four resolved. Investigation upgraded from ACTIVE to ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE. The sole remaining gap is the numerator identification (n_c = 11 imaginary directions <-> QFT gauge modes), which is [A-PHYSICAL] and arguably Weinberg-forced.

## Key Findings

1. **D-Dependent Formula Disambiguation** [UNTESTABLE]: Two candidate formulas for the gauge beta coefficient in general D agree ONLY at D=4 (difference factors as -(D-4)(D+1)/(2(D-1))). Dim-reg cannot disambiguate. D=3 is super-renormalizable. Framework rigidly selects D=4, making the question moot.

2. **S = S_EM = 126 is D=4-Specific** [DERIVATION]: Grassmannian scalar curvature S(Gr(4,11)) = 126 equals the EM charge index S_EM = 126 from S297. Both factor as C_dim x Im_H^2 x Im_O where C_dim = n_d/2 = 2 (Cayley-Dickson). The identity n_d(n_c-2)/2 = 6*Im_H holds iff n_d = 4. Upgraded from "likely coincidence" (S296) to [DERIVATION].

3. **11/3 NOT a Representation Dimension Ratio** [THEOREM]: Exhaustive search of SO(11), SO(7), SO(4), G_2, SU(3), SU(2) representation dimensions. 295 compound matches found, but ALL use dim=11 or dim=3 (n_c or Im_H in disguise). Zero truly novel matches. 11/3 is composite, not a single rep-theoretic quantity.

4. **Paramagnetic-Noncommutative Chain** [DERIVATION with 1 A-PHYSICAL]: Full 8-link chain from division algebra classification to 11/3. Status: 4 [THEOREM], 2 [DERIVATION], 1 [A-PHYSICAL] (mode counting). UV-IR connection: 10/3 = Im_H + 1/Im_H appears in BOTH beta function (UV) and glueball mass (IR).

## Open Questions

1. **Mode counting (EQ-008 residual)**: WHY do n_c = 11 imaginary directions map to QFT gauge boson loop modes? This is [A-PHYSICAL], arguably Weinberg-forced (all defining properties present, no alternatives). Probably irreducible. (EQ-008)

## EQ-008 Cumulative Summary

| Session | Contribution | Tests |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| S289 | Universal S_2^f = 6 [DERIVATION]. 11/3 = n_c/Im_H [CONJECTURE] | 34 |
| S295 | Beta coefficient framework decomposition | 23 |
| S296 | 5 structural approaches. D=4 quadratic identity [THEOREM]. Cayley-Dickson [THEOREM]. 2 dead ends | 94 |
| S303 | Denominator RESOLVED [DERIVATION]. 1/(D-1) = 1/Im_H | 20 |
| S305 | Four remaining directions. S=S_EM [DERIVATION]. Not a rep ratio [THEOREM]. Paramagnetic chain. EQ-008 ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE | 54 |
| **Total** | **10 scripts** | **168/168 PASS** |

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-008 is ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE after 6 sessions and 168 tests. The 11/3 = n_c/Im_H identity is now supported by: denominator [DERIVATION], D=4 quadratic identity [THEOREM], Cayley-Dickson [THEOREM], S=S_EM [DERIVATION], not a rep ratio [THEOREM], and a full paramagnetic chain with only one [A-PHYSICAL] gap (mode counting). The investigation file has been upgraded to ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE status. Next priorities: Band A testable predictions (EQ-039), or a new physics topic.
