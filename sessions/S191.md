# Session 191 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: "What IS the CMB?" — Full CMB investigation and synthesis
**Topic**: CMB physics (`topics/cmb-physics.md`)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S190 (Phase 4D collider audit), S170 (CMB Phase 5.2 statistics)

---

## Outcome

Comprehensive investigation of the CMB's identity within the Perspective framework. Four investigation tasks completed: SO(11) epoch mapping, sound speed derivation attempts, inflationary amplitude search, and full synthesis document. Result: the framework derives the CMB's spectral *shape* (n_s, r) but not its *amplitude* (V₀) or *absolute scale* (r_s from first principles). 8 open gaps documented honestly.

## Key Findings

1. **[DERIVED] SO(11) epochs fully mapped**: All 43 Goldstones tracked through 4 stages. Stage 1 (28 = n_d·Im_O) → inflation. Stage 4 (2 = C) → EWSB. Stages 2-3 energy scales = GAP.

2. **[CONJECTURE CONFIRMED] c_s = 3/7 NOT derivable**: All 4 paths tested fail. Path C (standard formula) REFUTES c_s = 3/7 — standard physics gives c_s = 0.454, 5.6% higher. The r_s = 337 × 3/7 match involves compensating errors (η_* too high, c_s too low). HRS remains 7.

3. **[GAP] V₀ not derivable**: Required α^4.16 — not a clean framework expression. Closest: α⁴·Im_O/n_c (ratio 1.38×). A_s coefficient 63π²/1000 has framework structure (63 = Im_O·Im_H², 1000 = (Im_H+Im_O)³) but A_s itself is imported.

4. **[SYNTHESIS] Full CMB interpretation written**: Scorecard: 8 derived, 6 imported, 5 conjectured, 8 gaps. 110/110 verification tests PASS across 4 scripts. Topic file `topics/cmb-physics.md` created.

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Modified acoustic equation**: Could crystallization physics produce a fundamentally different wave equation where c_s = 3/7 emerges?
2. **V₀ from CW potential**: Once the full Coleman-Weinberg potential is computed with SO(11) field content, does it fix V₀?
3. **η_* from cosmological integral**: Compute ∫₀^{a_*} da/(a²H(a)) using only H₀ = 337/5 and Ω values — does it give 337 Mpc?
4. **Stage 2-3 dynamics**: Can the SO(7) → G₂ → SU(3) scales be derived from the one-loop beta functions?
5. **Colored scalar phenomenology**: What mass do the 24 Stage-1 colored scalars have? LHC constraints?

## Key Context for Next Session

The CMB investigation revealed a clear split: the framework excels at deriving *dimensionless ratios* (n_s, r) from algebraic structure, but fails at *absolute scales* (V₀, η_*). This mirrors the wider framework pattern — corrections and ratios are defensible, main terms and absolute values are often post-hoc. The c_s = 3/7 claim is weaker than previously thought (standard physics refutes it). The honest gap accounting shows 8 unresolved items, with V₀ being the most fundamental.
