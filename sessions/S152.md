# Session 152 — QCD String Tension from O-Channel

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Focus**: E5 from S150 — QCD string tension from O-channel Casimir picture
**Topic**: `topics/casimir-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S150 (Casimir as crystallization pressure)
**Next**: S156 (Casimir deeper: E1-E3)

## Outcome

6 findings formalized. Beta coefficients = framework numbers. Luscher = piC/(O*Im_H). sqrt(sigma) = 8m_p/17 [CONJECTURE, HRS=5-6]. Derivation attempt via QCD dynamics: decomposition found but not derivable. 30/30 PASS across 2 scripts.

## Key Findings

1. **QCD beta coefficients decompose into framework numbers**: b_0=33=Im_H*n_c, b_0(N_f=6)=7=Im_O, b_1 pure glue=153=Im_H^2*17. 153 also in m_p/m_e = 12*153 + 11/72.
2. **Luscher term = piC/(O*Im_H) = pi/12** [DERIVATION]. 24 = O*Im_H = n_d! (unique to n_d=4).
3. **O/C mode ratio = n_d = 4** [DERIVATION]
4. **sqrt(sigma) = 8m_p/17 = 441.5 MeV** (0.35% from measured ~440) [CONJECTURE, HRS=6]
5. **Constituent quark decomposition**: m_p = Im_H * m_q, m_q/sqrt(sigma) = 17/24 [CONJECTURE, HRS=5]
6. **24 appears in BOTH Luscher and constituent mass**: coincidence or connection?

## Open Questions

1. Better lattice data for m_constituent/sqrt(sigma) to test 17/24 conjecture
2. Whether 24 = O*Im_H in Luscher and constituent mass are connected
3. E1: Tilt field Casimir between black hole horizons
4. E2: Vacuum energy and cosmological constant connection
