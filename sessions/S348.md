# Session S348: Launch C1b -- Interpretive Companion v1.0, Chunk 2

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Write Interpretive Companion v1.0 Chunk 2 (Sections 5-8: Part II)
**Parallel**: S347 (Alpha D_3 derivation)

---

## Outcome

**C1b Chunk 2 COMPLETE.** Part II: Geometric Consequences (Sections 5-8) written into `PC_INTERPRETIVE_COMPANION.md`. Document now at 851 lines (up from 456). ~395 new lines.

## Key Findings

### What Was Written

| Component | Lines | Content |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Part II header | ~8 | Introduction to geometric consequences, IRA-06/07 preview |
| Section 5 | ~78 | The Space of All Perspectives: Grassmannian Gr+(4,11;R), topology (chi=20, b_4=2, H_2=Z/2), quaternion-Kahler, S291 corrections |
| Section 6 | ~105 | How Structure Crystallizes: tilt space, Z_2 theorem (CONJ-B1), Mexican hat, IRA-06 (SSB) with full 8-property Weinberg table, 28 Goldstones, gradient flow convergence |
| Section 7 | ~90 | What Observation Creates: evaluation map (THM_04AC), 77-dim kernel, self-inaccessibility, rank selection, M_2(C) observable algebra, composition blindness |
| Section 8 | ~110 | Why Time Is Different: Herm(2), 1+3 split, IRA-07 with 6-property Weinberg table, two quadratic forms, spectral metric selection, irreducibility theorem (3 spatial dims forced), full derivation chain CCP->SO+(1,3), Jordan algebra family |

### Design Decisions

1. **Both surviving [A-PHYSICAL] IRAs given full Weinberg-criterion treatment** -- IRA-06 with 8-property table, IRA-07 with 6-property table
2. **Explicit "what remains irreducible" paragraphs** -- acknowledges these are meta-assumptions of mathematical physics
3. **Section 5 includes S291 correction** -- chi=20 not 330 (real vs complex Grassmannian)
4. **Section 6 explains WHY rectangular matrices force Z_2** -- the 4x7 shape prevents cubic terms
5. **Section 7 quantifies observational limits** -- 44/121 = 36% accessible
6. **Section 8 derives all of Lorentz from CCP** -- complete chain with no spacetime assumptions
7. **No proofs duplicated** -- references math paper theorems by number only

### Chunk Plan Progress

| Chunk | Sections | Status | Lines |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| **1** | Frontmatter + 1-4 | **COMPLETE (S345)** | 456 |
| **2** | 5-8 | **COMPLETE (S348)** | ~395 |
| 3 | 9-12 | NOT STARTED | ~450 est |
| 4 | 13-16 | NOT STARTED | ~500 est |
| 5 | 17-20 | NOT STARTED | ~400 est |
| 6 | Appendices + review | NOT STARTED | ~350 est |

## Scripts

No new verification scripts (companion is interpretive, not computational).

## Open Questions

- Chunk 3 (Sections 9-12) covers Part III: Algebraic Structure (endomorphism decomposition, gauge pipeline, fermion content, generation structure). Heavy on group theory.
- Section 9 will need the 121 = 44 + 77 decomposition from the evaluation map
- Section 10 (gauge pipeline) is the most technically dense section -- may need careful pacing for the physicist audience
- Section 12 (generations) touches on dim(Im(H)) = 3 identification

## Key Context for Next Session

Chunk 3 covers Part III: Algebraic Structure. Key sources:
- Math paper Sections 9-12 (lines ~720-1100)
- `framework/investigations/particles/generation_structure.md`
- S297 (gauge pipeline completion)
- Topics: `step5-alpha-mechanism.md`, `weinberg-angle.md`

No new [A-PHYSICAL] IRAs enter in Part III -- the two physical assumptions (IRA-06, IRA-07) are already in place. Part III develops the algebraic consequences of crystallization for gauge theory and matter content.
