# Session 244: Gaussian Norm Unification — Prime Attractors and Li-7

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Prime attractor foundations, Li-7 institutional memory recovery, CNH discovery
**Topic**: `topics/prime-attractors.md` (to be created)
**Status**: MAJOR FINDING
**Previous**: S100 (Li-7 solution), S73-S84 (prime attractor development)

---

## Outcome

Discovered that AXM_0118 (Prime Attractor Selection) and the Li-7 crystallization mechanism (S100) are **the same mathematical principle** — the Gaussian norm from the ring of integers Z[i] of the complex numbers C.

---

## Key Findings

1. **[DERIVATION] BBN catalog gap corrected**: The S229 BBN sub-catalog said "Nothing" for Li-7. This was wrong — S100 had a complete solution (Li-7/H = BBN/3, 2.08% error, 8/8 PASS). Fixed in `bbn_nucleosynthesis.md`, tag upgraded to [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED].

2. **[THEOREM] Division algebra dimensions = Gaussian norms**: The Gaussian norm N(a+bi) = a²+b² exactly separates D_framework: {1,2,4,8} are all norms, {3,7,11} are all non-norms. This is forced by number theory: dim(A) = 2^k (always norm), Im(A) = 2^k-1 ≡ 3 mod 4 for k≥2 (never norm when prime).

3. **[DERIVATION] AXM_0118 = Gaussian norm primes**: All 10 framework primes from AXM_0118 are Gaussian norm primes (p=2 or p ≡ 1 mod 4). AXM_0118 is the CNH applied to coupling constants.

4. **[DERIVATION] Li-7 = Gaussian norm incompatibility**: Li-7 is the only BBN nucleus where BOTH A=7 and Z=3 are non-norms (inert in Z[i]). The destruction reaction Li-7+p → 2He-4 converts non-norm → norm. This is the CNH applied to nuclear structure.

5. **[CONJECTURE] Crystallization Norm Hypothesis (CNH)**: C is the UNIQUE division algebra whose norm provides non-trivial discriminating power (R too restrictive, H/O too permissive by Lagrange). Proposed: crystallization dynamics (AXM_0117) operate through the C-norm, unifying prime selection and nuclear suppression.

6. **[OPEN] Suppression factor 1/3**: The specific factor 1/Im_H = 1/3 is not yet derived from the CNH. Candidate: 3 is the smallest inert prime in Z[i] and equals Z for Li-7.

## Files Modified

- `framework/crystallization_processes/phase_transitions/bbn_nucleosynthesis.md` — Li-7 entry corrected
- `verification/sympy/gaussian_norm_unification.py` — NEW, 17/17 PASS

## Open Questions

1. **Suppression factor derivation** (EQ-NEW): Can 1/Im_H = 1/3 be derived from the CNH? Is it 1/(smallest inert prime dividing Z)?
2. **AXM_0118 replacement**: Should AXM_0118 be replaced by the CNH as the deeper axiom?
3. **Extended primes**: Primes 97=(4,9) and 109=(3,10) use components outside D_framework. What does the CNH say about these?
4. **Implications scan**: Which existing "fitted" formulas become "forced" under the CNH?
5. **Role of 2**: 2 is both a structural prime AND a Gaussian norm (the ramified prime in Z[i]). Physical meaning?
6. **n_c as non-norm**: n_c = 11 is a non-norm appearing as a COMPONENT in norm primes (137 = 4²+11²). What does this mean in the CNH?
7. **Predictions**: The CNH predicts specific suppression patterns for other light nuclei (Li-6, B-11, C-12). Testable?

## Key Context for Next Session

The Crystallization Norm Hypothesis (CNH) unifies two previously separate framework principles through the Gaussian norm N(a+bi) = a²+b² from Z[i]. The mathematical proof that {1,2,4,8} are norms and {3,7,11} are non-norms is a theorem (not pattern-matching). C is the unique division algebra whose norm provides non-trivial discriminating power. This potentially replaces AXM_0118 with something deeper, and the implications for the "derivation vs discovery" problem could be significant — if the CNH turns formulas from "fitted" to "forced", it strengthens the framework's claim to genuine physics.
