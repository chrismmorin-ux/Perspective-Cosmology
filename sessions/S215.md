# Session 215: Coset Geometry — Three Paths to sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Can the coset geometry prediction sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121 be promoted from [CONJECTURE] to [DERIVATION]?
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`, `topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S211 (priority triage), S160 (gap analysis)

## Outcome

Systematic investigation of three candidate paths for deriving sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121. One path eliminated (HS metric), one partially productive (coset geometry), one promising with a clear residual gap (Born rule / democratic counting). The gap has been narrowed from "why 28/121?" to a single question: "why democratic counting instead of Dynkin-weighted counting?" Four candidate resolutions identified but none proven.

## Key Findings

### 1. Path A: HS Metric Argument — FAILS [THEOREM]

The HS inner product from AXM_0110 gives all elementary matrices E_{ij} the same norm 1/sqrt(n_c). But this is a **universal rescaling** — it multiplies all mode contributions by the same factor 1/n_c. Since sin^2(theta_W) = g'^2/(g^2 + g'^2) is a ratio of couplings, a universal rescaling cancels. The one-loop commutator [A_mu, M] introduces representation dependence (Dynkin indices) regardless of the metric on the scalar field space. Dead end.

### 2. Path B: Connection on Coset — PARTIAL [DERIVATION for structure]

The coset SO(11)/(SO(4) x SO(7)) has dim = 28 = n_d x Im_O, correctly identifying the numerator. But the formula needs denominator 121 = dim(End(V)), not 55 = dim(SO(11)). Key structural identity: the coset cross-term in Lambda^2(n_c) has the SAME dimension as Hom(W^perp, W) in the eval map decomposition — both are 28. This is because the antisymmetric cross-term between the two blocks is the full bifundamental (4,7). The eval map naturally provides 121 as the denominator.

**New finding**: dim(coset)/dim(SO(11)) = 28/55 = 0.509 does NOT match sin^2(theta_W). Only dim(coset)/dim(End(V)) = 28/121 matches. This tells us the relevant "space" is the full operator algebra End(V), not just the Lie algebra so(11).

### 3. Path C: Born Rule on Configuration Space — PROMISING [CONJECTURE]

The democratic counting formula sin^2(theta_W) = N_2/(N_1 + N_2) = 28/121 works exactly with:
- N_2 = 28 = dim(Hom(W^perp, W)) = gauge connections (hidden -> visible)
- N_1 = 93 = dim(End(V)) - 28 = everything else
- N_1 = 16 (gravity) + 28 (matter) + 49 (hidden dynamics)

Equivalent to Bernoulli variance p(1-p) with p = n_d/n_c = 4/11. Physical interpretation: sin^2(theta_W) = transition probability between visible and hidden sectors for a random direction in V_Crystal.

**The residual gap**: Why democratic counting (each mode contributes 1) rather than Dynkin-weighted counting (each mode contributes T_i)? The standard one-loop computation gives T_L = 22, not N_SU2 = 28.

### 4. Synthesis: Four Candidate Resolutions (all unproven)

(i) **Non-perturbative**: First-order transition (proven S211) means perturbative one-loop may not apply. Democratic counting could be a non-perturbative result.
(ii) **Lattice**: On a discrete End(V), coupling determined by nearest-neighbor counting, not continuous representation theory.
(iii) **Information-theoretic**: Coupling measures fraction of information transferred between sectors — depends on dimensions, not representations.
(iv) **Emergent gauge field**: If A_mu is a collective mode, its coupling to crystal modes is geometric (HS norm) not group-theoretic (Dynkin index).

## Open Questions

1. **Why democratic counting?** The single remaining gap. Can the first-order nature of the SO(11) transition (proven S211) be shown to produce democratic mode weights non-perturbatively?
2. **SU(3) mode counting**: Does the democratic formula predict 1/alpha_s correctly? Requires full SU(3) representation decomposition of End(V) under SO(7) -> G_2 -> SU(3).
3. **137 = 121 + 16 physics**: The EM coupling uses all 137 modes (crystal + defect), but the Weinberg angle uses only the 121 crystal modes. Is this because the 16 defect modes contribute to gravity-EM mixing, not gauge mixing?

## Key Context for Next Session

Three paths tested for promoting sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121 from [CONJECTURE] to [DERIVATION]. Path A (HS metric) is a dead end — universal rescaling can't change ratios. Path B (coset geometry) gives the numerator 28 but needs the eval map's End(V) = 121 for the denominator. Path C (democratic counting) gives the right answer but the gap is: why does each crystal mode contribute equally rather than proportionally to its Dynkin index? The most promising resolution is (i): the first-order nature of the phase transition (already proven) may force non-perturbative democratic counting. This needs a concrete argument — perhaps from lattice gauge theory or from the structure of first-order transitions in sigma models.
