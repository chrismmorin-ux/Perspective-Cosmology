# Session 236: Crystallization Catalog Expansion -- Phase 7 Batch 1

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog Phase 7 batch 1: EM decays, nuclear decays, weak scattering, gravitational scattering sub-catalogs
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S234 (Phase 6 cosmological)

## Outcome

Phase 7 batch 1 of the Crystallization Catalog expansion is complete. Four new sub-catalog files created: `electromagnetic_decays.md` (3 processes: pi0->gg anomaly, radiative baryon decays, positronium annihilation), `nuclear_decays.md` (3 processes: alpha decay, nuclear beta decay, nuclear gamma decay), `weak_scattering.md` (4 processes: neutrino CC scattering, neutrino NC scattering, inverse beta decay, CEvNS), and `gravitational_scattering.md` (4 processes: gravitational lensing, perihelion precession, Shapiro delay, frame dragging). C10, C11, C13, and C15 updated with sub-catalog cross-references. No new verification scripts needed (all entries reference existing scripts or are [STANDARD-RELABELED]). Catalog updated v3.6 -> v3.7 (58 scripts, 723 tests unchanged).

## Key Findings

1. **Electromagnetic decays: pi0 anomaly is the standout** [honest assessment]: Of 3 entries, only pi0->gg is [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (N_c = Im_H = 3 enters the ABJ anomaly coefficient quadratically). Radiative baryon decays and positronium annihilation are [STANDARD-RELABELED]. The pi0 rate scaling as N_c^2 * alpha^2 is a genuine structural result, though it's also a standard QCD prediction.

2. **Nuclear decays entirely [STANDARD-RELABELED]** [honest assessment]: All 3 entries (alpha, beta, gamma) are relabeled. Nuclear physics is dominated by [A-IMPORT] quantities — potentials, matrix elements, coupling constants. Framework adds chain classification (C13->C4->C13 for alpha, C13->C10->C13 for beta, C13->C8->C13 for gamma) and multi-channel identification but no predictive content.

3. **Weak scattering has genuine sin^2(theta_W) tests** [honest assessment]: 2/4 entries [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (neutrino NC scattering and CEvNS), where sin^2 = 28/121 enters cross-sections directly through the weak nuclear charge Q_W and the NC/CC ratio. The NuTeV anomaly is noted (nuclear isospin violation, not new physics). COHERENT measurements (~30% precision) are consistent but not yet precise enough to distinguish 28/121 from SM running.

4. **Gravitational scattering entirely [STANDARD-RELABELED]** [honest assessment]: All 4 entries are GR predictions confirmed to high precision (<0.01% for perihelion, <0.01% for Shapiro). The framework derives the Einstein equations from crystallization [DERIVATION], but the specific scattering predictions are standard GR consequences. R-channel labeling is organizational, not predictive.

5. **Sub-catalog system now at 20 files, 80 process entries** [catalog expansion]: With Phase 7 batch 1, the system covers decays (15 in 4 files), scattering (17 in 4 files), bound states (10 in 2 files), phase transitions (12 in 3 files), astrophysical (13 in 3 files), and cosmological (13 in 4 files). Seven dedicated verification scripts (107/107 PASS from sub-catalog scripts alone).

## Scripts

No new scripts created. All entries reference existing verification:
- `r_ratio_crystallization.py` (15/15 PASS) — pi0 anomaly N_c cross-check
- `hadron_mass_crystallization.py` (16/16 PASS) — pion sector
- `weak_decay_mode_counting.py` (16/16 PASS) — nuclear beta decay modes
- `z_boson_couplings_crystallization.py` (12/12 PASS) — sin^2 in NC cross-sections
- `astrophysical_crystallization.py` (12/12 PASS) — GR tests

## Files Created

| File | Type |
|------|------|
| `framework/crystallization_processes/decays/electromagnetic_decays.md` | Sub-catalog (3 processes) |
| `framework/crystallization_processes/decays/nuclear_decays.md` | Sub-catalog (3 processes) |
| `framework/crystallization_processes/scattering/weak_scattering.md` | Sub-catalog (4 processes) |
| `framework/crystallization_processes/scattering/gravitational_scattering.md` | Sub-catalog (4 processes) |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `framework/CRYSTALLIZATION_CATALOG.md` | v3.6->v3.7: C10/C11/C13/C15 updated with sub-catalog cross-refs, session history updated |
| `framework/crystallization_processes/README.md` | decays/ (2->4 files, 9->15 entries), scattering/ (2->4 files, 9->17 entries) |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | S236 registered |

## Open Questions

1. **DM mass formula discrepancy** (EQ-013): Carried from S234. m_e * n_c^2/n_d = 15.5 MeV, not 5.11 GeV. Needs investigation.
2. **CKM matrix derivation** (C10 gap): Still the critical missing piece for weak decay predictions. No progress this session (organizational only).
3. **COHERENT precision insufficient**: sin^2(theta_W) from CEvNS currently at ~30% precision. COHERENT-200 and reactor experiments will improve to ~5%. Framework 28/121 vs SM running distinguishable in principle.
4. **Remaining Phase 7 sub-catalogs**: quarkonia_and_glueballs.md, atomic_structure.md, recombination_and_reionization.md, baryogenesis.md, high_energy_astrophysics.md still needed.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 7 batch 1 complete. The sub-catalog system now has 20 files with 80 process entries across 6 subdirectories. Catalog v3.7 (58 scripts, 723 tests, unchanged from v3.6 since no new scripts needed). The honesty tagging shows the pattern clearly: framework content is strongest where sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121 or N_c = Im_H = 3 enter cross-sections/rates directly. Nuclear and gravitational processes are almost entirely [STANDARD-RELABELED]. Remaining Phase 7 sub-catalogs: quarkonia/glueballs, atomic structure, recombination/reionization, baryogenesis, high-energy astrophysics (5 more files, estimated ~18 more process entries).

**Recommended next**: Phase 7 batch 2 (remaining sub-catalogs) or return to physics investigations (EQ-002 Om_m mechanism, EQ-013 DM mass, EQ-006 top Yukawa).
