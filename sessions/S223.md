# Session 223: Crystallization Catalog Expansion — Phase 1 Electroweak Decays

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog Phase 1: electroweak decay sub-catalogs and verification
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog system
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S221 (Phase 0 infrastructure)

---

## Outcome

Phase 1 of the Crystallization Catalog expansion is complete. C10 (Weak Decay) fleshed out from skeleton to full entry with mode counting, 11 observables, and 4 verification script references. Two sub-catalog files created: `weak_decays.md` (5 processes: neutron beta, muon, pion, kaon, tau) and `electroweak_boson_decays.md` (4 processes: Z→ff̄, W→ff̄', H→XX, t→bW). Two new verification scripts written and validated (32/32 PASS). Honest tagging applied throughout: weak decays are majority [STANDARD-RELABELED], Z/W decays are [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED].

## Key Findings

1. **W branching from mode counting** [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED]: Im_H + 2N_c = 3 + 6 = 9 channels. Born BR(W→lν) = 1/9 = 11.1%. QCD-corrected: 10.82% (measured 10.86%). Total width 2.099 GeV (measured 2.085 ± 0.042, +0.3σ). 16/16 PASS.

2. **Tau branching from N_c** [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED]: R_τ = N_c × (1+QCD) ≈ 3.54 at NLO (measured 3.64). BR(τ→eνν) = 18.1% (measured 17.82%, 1.3%). Mode counting works; QCD corrections are [A-IMPORT].

3. **Weak decays: honest assessment**: 4/5 individual weak decay processes are [STANDARD-RELABELED]. Only tau decay is [FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED] (via N_c = 3). CKM matrix values are entirely [A-IMPORT] — the biggest gap for C10 predictive content.

4. **Z branching consolidated**: Existing 18/20 observables from sin²θ_W = 28/121 (S163) now documented in sub-catalog with full honesty tags. Remains the framework's strongest electroweak test.

5. **N_c = Im_H coincidence noted**: Both equal 3, but from different origins (quaternion imaginary dimensions vs SU(3) eigenvalue selection). Total W channels = 3×Im_H = 9 is algebraically neat but the equality N_c = Im_H is not derived from a common source.

## Files Created

| File | Type |
|------|------|
| `verification/sympy/weak_decay_mode_counting.py` | Verification script |
| `verification/sympy/w_branching_crystallization.py` | Verification script |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `framework/CRYSTALLIZATION_CATALOG.md` | v3.0→v3.1: C10 fleshed out (skeleton→full entry), 2 new scripts in index, script totals updated (53 scripts, 648 tests), CKM gap added to tracker, session history updated |
| `framework/crystallization_processes/README.md` | decays/ status updated (0→2 files, 9 entries) |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | S223 registered then deregistered |

## Open Questions

1. **CKM derivation** (EQ-028 related): The CKM matrix remains entirely [A-IMPORT]. Deriving even one element (e.g., V_us ≈ 0.225) from Im(H) structure would be a major advance.
2. **Phase 2 ready**: Scattering processes (electromagnetic, strong, weak) are next. EM scattering has some framework content via alpha = 1/137 vertex structure.
3. **Tau BR residual**: Predicted 18.1% vs measured 17.82% (1.3%). The gap likely comes from higher-order QCD and mass corrections. Not a framework issue.
4. **W→τν anomaly**: Measured BR(W→τν) = 11.38% vs predicted 10.82% (−2.7σ). Known LEP anomaly, not framework-specific. Lepton universality violation at ~3% level — monitor.

## Key Context for Next Session

Phase 1 electroweak decays complete. The `decays/` subdirectory now has 2 files with 9 process entries covering all major weak and electroweak boson decays. The framework's main contribution to weak decays is mode counting (Im_H, N_c) rather than rate predictions. Z branching via sin²θ_W = 28/121 remains the strongest electroweak test (64 tests across 4 scripts). CKM derivation is the critical missing piece for C10.

**Recommended next**: Phase 2 (scattering processes — EM scattering has more framework content) or Phase 3 (bound states — hadron masses, nuclear binding). Alternatively, return to physics investigations (EQ-003 coset geometry, EQ-007 two-regime mechanism).
