# Session 168 — 2026-01-31

**Focus**: Eigenvalue selection problem — b₂/b₁ ratio determines SM gauge group
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S166 (flat direction discovery)

## Outcome

Solved the eigenvalue selection problem from S166. The sign of the Tr(ε⁴) coupling b₂ in the tilt potential completely determines the symmetry breaking pattern of U(n_d) on Herm(n_d). For b₂ < 0 with n_d = 4, the global minimum is the maximally broken VEV, giving U(4) → U(3) × U(1) ≃ SU(3) × U(1)². SU(3) is the SM color group. The framework argument: AXM_0117 (crystallization tendency) implies tilt concentrates in specific directions, which corresponds to b₂ < 0. This closes the eigenvalue selection problem and provides a MECHANISM for why SU(3) emerges.

## Key Findings

1. **[F21] Eigenvalue Selection Theorem** [DERIVATION]: For W = -a·Tr(ε²) + b₁·(Tr(ε²))² + b₂·Tr(ε⁴), the energy at k-eigenvalue extremum is W_k = -ka²/(4(kb₁+b₂)). For b₂ < 0: k=1 (maximal breaking); b₂ > 0: k=n (no breaking); b₂ = 0: flat direction. (22/22 PASS)

2. **[F22] SU(3) from n_d=4 + b₂<0** [DERIVATION]: Non-traceless gives U(4) → U(3)×U(1); traceless gives SU(4) → SU(3)×U(1). Both produce SU(3) as unbroken non-abelian factor. Only n_d = 4 = dim(H) gives SU(3). Chain: Frobenius → n_d=4, AXM_0117 → b₂<0, Herm(4) minimization → SU(3).

3. **[F23] Crystallization → b₂<0** [CONJECTURE]: AXM_0117 implies tilt concentrates. Concentration index C = Tr(ε⁴)/[Tr(ε²)]² is 7/12 at SU(3)×U(1) vs 1/4 at SU(2)²×U(1). b₂ < 0 favors high concentration. Physical analogy: crystal defects attract and cluster.

4. **[F24] Traceless phase diagram** [DERIVATION]: Three critical points — Pattern A (3α,-α,-α,-α) → SU(3)×U(1), Pattern B (α,α,-α,-α) → SU(2)²×U(1), Pattern C (α,-α,0,0) → SU(2)×U(1)². For b₂<0: W_A < W_B < W_C. For b₂>0: W_B < W_C < W_A. Energy differences proportional to b₂.

5. **[F25] Mass spectrum** [DERIVATION]: At SU(3)×U(1) minimum — Non-traceless: m²_rad = 4a (1 mode), m²_perp = -2ab₂/(b₁+b₂) (3 modes), 6 Goldstone. Traceless: m²_rad = 4a, m²_perp = -8ab₂/(12b₁+7b₂) (2 modes), 6 Goldstone. All positive for b₂ < 0 — true minimum confirmed.

## Open Questions

1. **Coleman-Weinberg verification**: Do one-loop quantum corrections to the tilt potential give b₂_eff < 0? This would provide a second, independent argument for b₂ < 0 beyond AXM_0117.

2. **Feynman rules from W(ε,φ)**: The explicit cubic/quartic vertices at the SU(3)×U(1) minimum would allow computing one-loop diagrams and confirming the -11/3 coefficient from Feynman rules rather than counting.

3. **SU(2) origin**: The eigenvalue selection gives SU(3)×U(1) from U(4). But SU(2)_L comes from SO(4) ⊂ SO(11), not from U(4). Need to integrate the Herm(4) analysis with the full SO(11) breaking chain.

4. **Leptoquark mass scale**: The 6 Goldstone bosons become massive "leptoquark" gauge bosons at the U(4) → U(3)×U(1) breaking scale. What determines this scale in the framework?

## Key Context for Continuation

S168 SOLVED the eigenvalue selection problem: the Tr(ε⁴) coupling sign determines the gauge group, and crystallization tendency (AXM_0117) selects b₂ < 0, giving SU(3)×U(1) = SM color. The derivation chain is: division algebras → n_d = 4, crystallization → b₂ < 0, Herm(4) minimization → SU(3). The single conjecture is sign(b₂) < 0 from AXM_0117 — a Coleman-Weinberg calculation would strengthen this. Next logical steps: (a) CW calculation for b₂ sign, (b) Feynman rules at SU(3)×U(1) VEV for -11/3 derivation, (c) integrate with SO(11) breaking for full SM group, or (d) new topic (neutrino masses, THM formalization).
