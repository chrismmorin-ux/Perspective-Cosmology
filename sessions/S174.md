# Session 174 — Full SM Gauge Group from SO(11) + F = C

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Focus**: Derive full SM gauge group SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y from the SO(11) breaking chain
**Topic**: Collider/crystallization (symmetry breaking chain)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S168 (eigenvalue selection), S132-133 (original chain)

---

## Outcome

F = C (THM_0485) does **double duty** in the SO(11) breaking chain, acting on both the internal and defect sectors to produce the complete Standard Model gauge group:

- **Internal** (Stage 3): G_2 -> SU(3) = Stab_{G_2}(C) [6 Goldstones]
- **Defect** (Stage 4, NEW): SO(4) -> U(2) = SU(2)_- x U(1)_J [2 Goldstones]

Combined: **SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y**, dim = 8 + 3 + 1 = 12 = n_c + 1.

The mechanism: so(4) = su(2)_+ + su(2)_- (self-dual/anti-self-dual). The Kahler form J from F = C lies in su(2)_+, breaking it to u(1) while fully preserving su(2)_-.

## Key Findings

### F1: SO(4) decomposes as su(2)_+ + su(2)_- [THEOREM]

so(4) = su(2)_+ + su(2)_- with [su(2)_+, su(2)_-] = 0. This is the standard self-dual / anti-self-dual decomposition of SO(4) [I-MATH]. Verified: T1-T4 PASS.

### F2: Kahler form J = -ep1 lies in su(2)_+ [DERIVATION]

The complex structure J on R^4 = C^2 (from F = C) is an antisymmetric orthogonal matrix with J^2 = -Id. It equals -ep1 (an element of the self-dual su(2)_+). Verified: T5-T8 PASS.

### F3: Stabilizer of J in SO(4) is U(2) = SU(2)_- x U(1)_J [DERIVATION]

[su(2)_-, J] = 0 (all 3 generators preserved), while in su(2)_+, only the span of J itself survives. The stabilizer has dimension 3 + 1 = 4 = dim(U(2)). Verified: T9-T11 PASS.

### F4: dim(SM gauge) = 12 = n_c + 1 [DERIVATION]

The full chain SO(11) -> SU(2)_L x U(1) x SU(3) gives dim = 12 = n_c + 1.

Total Goldstones: 55 - 12 = 43, decomposed as:
- Stage 1: 28 (spacetime/internal split)
- Stage 2: 7 (octonionic automorphism)
- Stage 3: 6 (F=C internal)
- Stage 4: 2 (F=C defect)

F=C Goldstones: 6 + 2 = 8 = dim(O). Verified: T12-T16 PASS.

### F5: Parity violation from oriented complex structure [CONJECTURE]

J distinguishes su(2)_+ from su(2)_-. The oriented complex structure (J vs -J) selects one SU(2) — this is the geometric origin of parity violation. Verified: T22 PASS (J and -J have same stabilizer, as expected for orientation choice).

### F6: EWSB gives U(1) x U(1), not U(1)_EM [OPEN]

A VEV on a complex line z_2 in C^2 preserves both J and em1 (2 generators), breaking only em2 and em3 (2 generators). This gives 2 massive bosons, but the SM has 3 (W+, W-, Z). The tilt field's VEV is in the adjoint/endomorphism representation, not as an SU(2) doublet. Full EWSB mechanism requires additional structure.

Verified: T17-T21 PASS.

## Open Questions

1. **EWSB mechanism**: How does the framework produce 3 massive bosons instead of 2? May need Higgs in the fundamental (doublet) representation of SU(2)_L, not the adjoint.

2. **U(1)_Y identification**: The u(1)_J from the Kahler form is identified with hypercharge. Is this consistent with the SM hypercharge assignments?

3. **c_3 > 0 derivation**: The (4,7) vs (3,8) selection at Stage 1 requires c_3 > 0 in the quartic potential. This is physically motivated but not axiomatically derived.

4. **SU(2)_L chirality**: The identification su(2)_- = su(2)_L (with P violation from J orientation) needs connection to the chiral structure of weak interactions.

## Key Context for Next Session

The full SO(11) breaking chain now has 4 stages (not 3), with F = C acting at stages 3 and 4. The remarkable coincidence that F=C Goldstones total 8 = dim(O) suggests deep algebraic structure. The main open problem is EWSB: the framework's tilt VEV produces 2 massive bosons instead of the SM's 3. This may connect to S166's Higgs BR analysis and the need for a Higgs doublet representation.
