# Session 171 -- 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Gap G7 resolution -- eps* convention conflict (alpha^2 vs alpha)
**Topic**: `topics/casimir-crystallization.md` (G7 from S169)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S169 (generalized crystallization pressure)

---

## Outcome

Resolved the eps* convention conflict (Gap G7 from S169). The two values eps* = alpha^2 and eps* = alpha describe DIFFERENT physical quantities, not conflicting definitions. Both are correct in their domains.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Two Distinct Order Parameters [DERIVATION]

The framework has two physically distinct equilibrium values:

- **eps*_portal = alpha^2 ~ 5.33e-5**: Cosmological order parameter. Portal coupling probability (two gauge vertices, amplitude alpha, probability alpha^2). Sets CMB: dT/T = alpha^2/3 ~ 1.78e-5 (0.2% match to measured). From DEF_02C0 (S100).

- **eps*_MH = alpha ~ 7.30e-3**: Local dynamics equilibrium. Mexican hat W(eps) = -a eps^2 + b eps^4 with b = alpha M_Pl^4 gives eps*_MH = sqrt(a/(2b)) = alpha. Tilt mass at GUT scale (~2e16 GeV). From S132-133 dynamics.

### Finding 2: Probability = Amplitude Squared [CONJECTURE]

The relationship eps*_portal = (eps*_MH)^2 mirrors the quantum mechanical Born rule: probability = |amplitude|^2. The cosmological tilt probability is the square of the local dynamics tilt amplitude. This is a structural observation, not a derived theorem.

### Finding 3: Shared Quadratic Coefficient [DERIVATION]

Both conventions yield the SAME value for the quadratic coefficient a = 2 alpha^3 M_Pl^4 when the quartic coefficient b is chosen naturally:
- Convention A with b = 137 M_Pl^4: a = 2 * 137 * alpha^4 M_Pl^4 = 2 alpha^3 M_Pl^4
- Convention B with b = alpha M_Pl^4: a = 2 * alpha * alpha^2 M_Pl^4 = 2 alpha^3 M_Pl^4

This gives the same tilt mass m_tilt ~ 2e16 GeV (GUT scale) regardless of convention.

### Finding 4: Stability Analysis [DERIVATION]

Four (eps*, b) combinations tested against m_tilt >> H_inflation:

| Option | m_tilt/H | Verdict |
|--------|----------|---------|
| eps*=alpha^2, b=M_Pl^4 | 2.9 | MARGINAL |
| eps*=alpha^2, b=137 M_Pl^4 | 34 | GOOD |
| eps*=alpha, b=M_Pl^4 | 402 | EXCELLENT |
| eps*=alpha, b=alpha M_Pl^4 | 34 | GOOD |

The natural choice b = alpha M_Pl^4 (Convention B) gives comfortable stability with GUT-scale mass.

## Open Questions

1. **Is eps*_portal = (eps*_MH)^2 the Born rule?** The probability-amplitude relationship mirrors QM but needs formal derivation from crystallization dynamics (connects to THM_0494).
2. **Why b = alpha M_Pl^4?** The quartic coefficient is alpha-suppressed relative to M_Pl^4. S133 established this from inflationary self-consistency but a deeper derivation is missing.
3. **DEF_02C4 slow-roll values**: The formula "eps_sr = Im_O/(2*mu^2)" in DEF_02C4 gives 49/3072, but the stated value is 7/3200. These differ -- the actual value involves the field value at N=60 e-folds. Minor notation issue to clean up.

## Key Context for Next Session

Gap G7 is CLOSED. The eps* convention conflict was a semantic confusion, not a physics error. The two values describe cosmological probability (alpha^2) vs local dynamics amplitude (alpha). The DEF files have been updated. The 8 remaining gaps from S169 are: G1 (nucleation trigger), G2 (a,b not derived from axioms), G3 (crystallization types as SSB stages), G4 (confinement = O-Casimir), G5 (particle masses), G6 (c_3 > 0), G8 (240 numerology), G9 (strong coupling). Most actionable next: G2 (deriving a,b from axioms) or returning to the CMB statistics session (S170 focus).
