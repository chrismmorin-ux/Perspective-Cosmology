# Session S276

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Weinberg angle one-loop coefficient structure (sin^2 dressed)
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S272 (Alpha: EM index density)
**Next**: Structural origin of 1/(4*pi) suppression; predict Band B coefficient

## Outcome

Derived the one-loop correction to sin^2(theta_W): **sin^2(dressed) = 28/121 - alpha/(4*pi^2)**, matching measured MS-bar value to 0.00 sigma (0.5 ppm residual). The coefficient C_W = 1 in the alpha/(4*pi^2) basis, or equivalently C_W = 1/(4*pi) in the alpha/pi basis. Computed all trace quantities (T_3, Y, Q_EM) on fundamental, coset, and colored sectors. The T_3 double-trace analog (C_W_T3 = 6/11) does NOT directly give C_W, requiring an additional 1/(4*pi) = 1/Vol(S^2) geometric suppression factor of unknown origin (NEGATIVE RESULT).

## Key Findings

1. **sin^2(dressed) = 28/121 - alpha/(4*pi^2)** [CONJECTURE]: Within measurement uncertainty (0.5 ppm residual, 1-parameter fit — C_W extracted from data, not predicted). The correction alpha/(4*pi^2) = 0.0001848 accounts for the entire 800 ppm gap. Alternative formula sin^2*cos^2*alpha/7 also matches (0.02 sigma, 0.24% different).

2. **4*pi^2 = n_d * pi^2** [THEOREM]: The denominator connects to spacetime: delta = n_d * alpha/(16*pi^2) = spacetime_dim * (standard one-loop EM factor). Also 4*pi^2 = dim(C) * Vol(S^3) = (16*pi^2)/n_d.

3. **T_3 trace quantities on coset** [THEOREM]: Tr(T_3^2)_fund = 1, Tr(T_3^2)_coset = Im_O = 7, Tr(T_3^2)_colored = 6, Tr(T_3^2)_Higgs = 1. Colored/total = 6/7 (same ratio as Q_EM). Index density rho_T3 = 1/11 = rho_EM/dim(C).

4. **C_alpha/C_W_T3 = n_d = 4** [THEOREM]: The alpha double-trace C_alpha = 24/11 divided by the T_3 analog C_W_T3 = 6/11 equals n_d exactly. Trace scaling by dim(C) = 2, squared.

5. **1/(4*pi) suppression is UNEXPLAINED** [NEGATIVE RESULT]: C_W = 1/(4*pi) but C_W_T3 = 6/11. The factor C_W/C_W_T3 = 0.146, not 1/(4*pi) = 0.0796. The T_3 double-trace structure does not directly produce the one-loop coefficient. The origin of 1/(4*pi) (possibly SU(2) solid angle averaging) is OPEN.

6. **Three-band paradigm extended** [CONJECTURE]: Bands A and C now have explicit coefficients. Band A: C_W = 1/(4*pi), delta(sin^2) = alpha/(4*pi^2). Band C: C_alpha = 24/11, delta(1/alpha) = (24/11)*alpha^2/pi. Band B (two-loop, 1.5-4.2 ppm) has no explicit coefficient yet.

## Open Questions

1. **Structural origin of 1/(4*pi)** (new): C_W = 1/(4*pi) in the alpha/pi basis. Is this 1/Vol(S^2), arising from SU(2) solid angle averaging in the weak sector? Or from the loop integral structure (the 4*pi^2 = n_d*pi^2 in the denominator)?

2. **Band B coefficient**: The two-loop band (cos theta_W, m_mu/m_e, v/m_p at 1.5-4.2 ppm) has no explicit coefficient. Can C_B be determined by the same method?

3. **Product formula proof** (EQ-039, ongoing): C = sum(Q^2)_colored x rho_EM = 24/11 remains [CONJECTURE].

## Key Context for Next Session

The tree->dressed paradigm now has explicit one-loop correction formulas for BOTH Band A (Weinberg) and Band C (alpha):

- Band A: sin^2(dressed) = 28/121 - alpha/(4*pi^2), coefficient = 1/(4*pi)
- Band C: 1/alpha(dressed) = 15211/111 - (24/11)*alpha^2/pi, coefficient = 24/11

The structural origin of 1/(4*pi) is the main open question. The T_3 trace analog (6/11) gives the wrong answer, unlike the Q_EM traces (24/11) which correctly give C_alpha. This asymmetry between alpha and Weinberg corrections needs explanation.

Direction (b) from the user's prompt (product formula proof) was not attempted this session -- lower priority and likely blocked by QFT machinery. The 1/(4*pi) question may be addressable algebraically.
