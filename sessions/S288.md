# Session S288: EQ-002 (Omega_m Mechanism) + EQ-003 (Alpha Step 5)

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: EQ-002 Omega_m = 63/200 mechanism + EQ-003 Alpha Step 5 irreducibility
**Topic**: Cosmology + Alpha
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S237 (EQ-002), S258 (CONJ-A3), S272 (EM index density)

## Outcome

Two investigations advanced. **EQ-002**: Found a **unified structural origin** for the denominator 200 = N_I + dim(su(4)+su(7)) = 137 + 63, partially resolving the denominator problem from S237. Discovered **EQ-002/EQ-003 duality**: both require the same "equal energy per mode" mechanism. **EQ-003**: Systematic analysis shows Step 5 is likely **irreducible** [A-STRUCTURAL] — a Layer 2 correspondence rule that cannot be derived from Layer 0. But sub-ppm correction accuracy and the duality provide strong structural support.

## Key Findings

1. **Unified origin for 200** [CONJECTURE]: 200 = N_I + N_internal = (n_d^2 + n_c^2) + (su(n_d) + su(n_c - n_d)) = 137 + 63. Dark energy <-> interface DOF (137), matter <-> internal structure DOF (63). Both come from End(R^{n_c}) decomposition under SO(4) x SO(7) + interface counting. PARTIALLY resolves S237 blocker #1 (no unified origin for 63 and 200).

2. **EQ-002/EQ-003 duality** [OBSERVATION]: Both alpha = 1/N_I and Omega_m = 63/200 follow from ONE principle: "each Lie algebra generator carries equal vacuum energy." Resolving EQ-003 automatically resolves EQ-002.

3. **Uniqueness** [DERIVATION]: n_c = 11 is the ONLY crystal dimension giving Omega_m within 1-sigma of Planck (Part 4 scan over n_c = 5..20). The (4,7) split within R^{11} is unique up to ordering.

4. **Triple formula resolution** [ANALYSIS]: 63/200 = 0.315 has structural support (End(V) partition). 6/19 = 0.3158 is pattern-matching only. Both within Planck 1-sigma (differ by 0.08%). 63/200 favored.

5. **Tree-to-dressed classification** [OBSERVATION]: Omega_m is Band D (correction ~950 ppm << measurement uncertainty ~23000 ppm).

6. **Step 5 irreducibility** [ANALYSIS]: Four arguments FOR irreducibility (gauge couplings need dynamics, normalization is convention, no physics analogy, Layer mismatch). Four arguments AGAINST (correction structure determined, duality, uniqueness 1/5000, sub-ppm precision). Balanced: Step 5 is likely [A-STRUCTURAL].

7. **Three mechanisms explored** [ANALYSIS]: Large-N scaling (g^2 ~ 1/dim(G)), Killing form normalization, CCP equipartition. All converge on alpha = 1/N_I but all require structural input.

8. **63 decomposes as 27 (gauge) + 36 (symmetric)** [DERIVATION]: The 63 internal structure generators split into so(4)+so(7)=27 antisymmetric (gauge) generators and 36 symmetric traceless generators. The 27 connects to the gauge pipeline (so(11)=55, coset=28).

## Open Questions

1. **"Equal energy per mode" derivation** (EQ-002 + EQ-003): Can CCP force equipartition of vacuum energy across Lie algebra generators? This is THE central open question. Resolution would close both EQ-002 and EQ-003.

2. **"Why now" problem** (EQ-002): Formula gives static ratio; Omega_m varies with z. Same as standard cosmic coincidence problem.

3. **Physical mapping** (EQ-002): "Internal structure generators = matter modes" — structurally motivated, not derived.

4. **Sigma model calculation** (EQ-003): One-loop calculation on SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) coset could derive gauge kinetic coefficient = N_I/4. Only remaining path to close Step 5.

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-002 and EQ-003 are DUAL problems sharing one principle ("equal vacuum energy per generator"). The unified origin 200 = 137 + 63 from End(R^{n_c}) partially resolves the denominator problem. Step 5 is classified as likely irreducible [A-STRUCTURAL]. The strongest new evidence is the duality: ONE principle -> TWO predictions (alpha + Omega_m). For further progress, either derive the equipartition principle from CCP, or perform an explicit sigma model calculation on the coset.
