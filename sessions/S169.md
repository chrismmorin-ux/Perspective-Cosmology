# Session 169 -- 2026-02-01

**Focus**: Generalized crystallization pressure -- unify C1-C9
**Topic**: `topics/casimir-crystallization.md` (extended)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S157 (Casimir completeness audit)

---

## Outcome

Identified that all 9 crystallization types (C1-C9) share a common three-factor pressure formula: Pi_gen = f_ch * (-dW/deps) * Omega(geometry). Each type is a specialization choosing specific channel weights, potential gradients, and geometric factors. This is a structural observation [CONJECTURE], not a formal theorem.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: General Pressure Formula [CONJECTURE]

All 9 types decompose as Pi = f_ch * (-dW/deps) * Omega where:
- f_ch = channel weight (which tilt DOF participate)
- -dW/deps = potential gradient from W(eps,phi) = -a g(phi)|eps|^2 + b|eps|^4
- Omega = boundary/scale factor

### Finding 2: Two Counting Schemes [DERIVATION]

Two distinct DOF counts exist in the framework:
- **16-DOF scheme**: Herm(n_d) tilt matrix, used by C3/C5/C6 (structural dynamics)
- **137-mode scheme**: N_I = n_d^2 + n_c^2 interface modes, used by C8 (emission/coupling)

These are NOT interchangeable. The ratio 16/2 = 8 = dim(O) connects them.

### Finding 3: 9-Type Comparison Table [DERIVATION]

Complete comparison of f_ch, Omega, channel, scale, and counting scheme for all 9 types. See investigation file for full table.

### Finding 4: 9 Gaps Identified [ANALYSIS]

Most significant gaps:
- G2: a, b in potential not derived from axioms
- G7: eps* convention conflict (alpha vs alpha^2)
- G9: Strong coupling from crystallization incomplete

## Open Questions

1. **eps* convention**: DEF_02C0 says alpha^2, dynamics says alpha. Which is correct? (Gap G7)
2. **Can the three-factor decomposition be proven complete?** Currently observed to hold, not derived.
3. **Is there a 10th crystallization type?** E.g., Hawking radiation as its own type vs a C5 sub-case.
4. **Can the two counting schemes (16 vs 137) be derived from a single principle?**

## Key Context for Next Session

The generalized pressure formula Pi = f_ch * (-dW/deps) * Omega is a useful organizational tool but remains [CONJECTURE]. The most actionable follow-up is resolving the eps* convention conflict (Gap G7), since it affects the specific parameter values in the formula. The two counting schemes (16-DOF vs 137-mode) are well-characterized but their relationship deserves deeper investigation.
