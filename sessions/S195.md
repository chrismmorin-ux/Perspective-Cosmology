# Session 195 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: Phase 6: Gravity — Honest assessment of GR derivation chain
**Topic**: Einstein equations (Section 1.17 in derivations_summary.md)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S192 (Phase 5 cosmology audit), S182 (Phase 2 — signature already assessed)
**Next**: Phase 7 (Statistical Validation), or resolve coset inconsistency, or resolve CC wrong sign

---

## Outcome

Phase 6 gravity audit of section 1.17 (Einstein Equations). Comprehensive step-by-step classification of the full GR derivation chain with honest [A]/[I]/[D] tags. Overall downgrade from DERIVATION to [HYBRID], grade C-. Three critical findings: (1) coset space inconsistency between investigation files and THM_0487, (2) verification scripts hardcode key claims as `True`, (3) cosmological constant derivation self-contradictory (V(ε*) gives wrong sign). CC honest cleanup: documented three incompatible CC formulas (13/19 vs 137/200 vs α⁵⁶/77), confirmed V(ε*)=-α⁶M_Pl²/2 < 0 via SymPy, flagged Tier 1 claims #2-3 with caveats. **Coset inconsistency RESOLVED**: S¹⁰ replaced by Gr(4,11) with 28 = 4+24 decomposition; signature redirected to THM_04AE; `coset_sigma_model_lorentz.py` DEPRECATED; 20/20 PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **A1 (3+1 dimensionality) — Grade B+** [THEOREM for n_d=4, A-PHYSICAL for R=time]
   n_d = 4 is the strongest result in the entire framework (THM_0484 CANONICAL). The 1+3 split from H = R ⊕ Im(H) is [I-MATH]. But R = time is [A-PHYSICAL, CONJECTURE] — no derivation for why the real quaternion direction maps to time.

2. **A2 (Lorentz signature) — Grade D+** [CONJECTURE]
   S182 already classified signature as [A-IMPORT]. The `coset_sigma_model_lorentz.py` script explicitly calls the spacetime identification a "HYPOTHESIS." The sign mechanism (radial→minus, angular→plus) is described in words, not calculated. None of the 8 script tests verify the actual signature emergence — they verify counting (1+3+6=10). **No tensor calculation exists.**

3. **A3 (Equivalence principle) — Grade B-** [I-MATH given metric]
   Automatic once metric emergence is accepted: single induced metric → universal coupling. Inherits A1/A2 weaknesses.

4. **A4 (EFE form) — Grade C** [HYBRID: I-MATH via Lovelock + A-STRUCTURAL + INCONSISTENCY]
   Lovelock's theorem is genuinely powerful — in 4D with general covariance and 2 derivatives, EFE is unique [I-MATH]. **This is the strongest step in A4.** But: (a) coset space is inconsistent (S¹⁰ vs Gr(4,11)), (b) 2-derivative truncation is [A-STRUCTURAL].

5. **CRITICAL: Coset space inconsistency — RESOLVED**
   Investigation files used SO(11)/SO(10) = S¹⁰ (10 Goldstones). THM_0487's actual breaking is SO(11) → SO(4) × SO(7), giving Grassmannian Gr(4,11) with **28 Goldstones**. **Resolution**: 28 = 4 (spacetime, (4,1) under SO(4)×SU(3)) + 24 (internal, (4,6)). The 4 spacetime modes and 1+3 split survive (from quaternion H = R + Im(H), independent of coset). The S¹⁰ signature mechanism (radial/angular) is INVALID on Gr(4,11) — replaced by THM_04AE (det form on Herm(2), signature (1,3)). `coset_sigma_model_lorentz.py` DEPRECATED. `coset_inconsistency_resolution.py` 20/20 PASS. A2 grade upgraded D+ → C+.

6. **Cosmological constant — Grade F** [SELF-CONTRADICTORY]
   V(ε*) = -α⁶M_Pl²/2 < 0 (confirmed via SymPy), but observed Λ > 0. The `einstein_from_crystallization.py` script itself says "these DON'T match!" Resolution via "crystallization STRESS" has no derivation — just narrative references to S94/S115. **Three incompatible CC formulas**: Ω_Λ = 13/19 (S94, section 1.11), Ω_Λ = 137/200 (S115, Tier 1), Λ/M_Pl⁴ = α⁵⁶/77 (S94). These give different numbers (13/19 ≈ 0.6842 vs 137/200 = 0.685) and can't all be right. All [CONJECTURE], none blind. Cleanup applied to derivations_summary, Tier 1 claims, README.

7. **Newton's G — Grade D** [A-IMPORT / definition]
   G = 1/(8πM_Pl²) is tautological — it defines G in terms of M_Pl. The Planck mass value is imported. α_G formula is [CONJECTURE].

8. **Verification script quality — Grade D**
   Key claims (signature emergence, EH action, graviton ID) are hardcoded `True` in all three scripts. Actual computational tests verify counting/arithmetic only.

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. ~~**Resolve coset inconsistency**~~ — **RESOLVED**: S¹⁰ discarded, Gr(4,11) is correct. 28 = 4+24 decomposition. Signature via THM_04AE.
2. ~~**Compute Lorentz signature**~~ — **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: THM_04AE provides algebraic signature (det form). No coset tensor calc needed. Remaining gap: why det (not Tr) is the physical metric [DERIVATION, not THEOREM].
3. **Fix CC wrong sign**: Either derive a positive Λ from the framework, or honestly acknowledge this is unsolved.
4. ~~**Physical interpretation of 24 internal modes**~~ — **RESOLVED (S195 continuation)**: The 24 = (4,6) modes are colored scalar pNGBs with quantum numbers (2,3)+(2,3̄) under SU(2)_L×SU(3)_c. They are leptoquark-like fields. Mass from QCD CW loops [CONJECTURE]. Also CORRECTED: the (4,1) modes are the Higgs doublet, not spacetime. See `colored_pngb_24_modes.py` (28/28 PASS).
5. **Phase 7 (Statistics)**: Formula search documentation for every sub-percent match.
6. **Phase 8 (Falsification)**: Update FALSIFICATION_REGISTRY with downgraded confidence from Phases 4-6.

## Key Context for Next Session

The Phase 6 gravity audit confirms S192's prediction of "C- at best." The pattern from Phases 4-6 is now clear: the framework produces genuine structural/algebraic results (n_d = 4, gauge groups, Lovelock → EFE form) but its numerical coefficients and physical interpretations are post-hoc or conjectured. The GR chain has a specific coset inconsistency that wasn't documented before — the simple S¹⁰ story doesn't match the actual THM_0487 breaking pattern. The three most impactful actions for improving the gravity grade would be: (1) resolve the coset inconsistency, (2) compute the signature via an actual tensor calculation, (3) derive Λ > 0 from first principles.
