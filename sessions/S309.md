# Session S309

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Focus**: Phi_6 cascade formalization + mathematical depth as complexity measure
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S308 (Band structure deep dive)
**Next**: Egyptian fraction physical interpretation; refine depth measure; experimental tests

---

## Outcome

Three investigations completed. (1) The Phi_6 cascade is formally identified as Sylvester's sequence, with a remarkable Egyptian fraction property: 1/dim_C + 1/Im_H + 1/Im_O + ... = 1. Band exclusivity is clean: each pure cascade value maps to exactly one band as a denominator, with deeper cascade values mapping to finer bands. Values beyond physics (1807, 12211) appear nowhere, not even as factors. (2) The structural depth measure D(n) provides a partial predictor: cyclotomic depth (D=3) exclusively maps to Bands B/C, but D(den) alone does NOT anti-correlate with gap (positive rho = +0.34, opposite to hypothesis). Total depth D(num)+D(den) does anti-correlate (rho = -0.37). The depth measure is a co-predictor with correction sector, not standalone. (3) Strong dressing is consistent but untestable: all Band D gaps are within measurement error (sigma < 1). The beta function ladder b_0(0)=n_c, b_0(3)=Im_H^2, b_0(6)=Im_O is notable.

## Key Findings

1. **Phi_6 cascade = Sylvester's sequence** [DERIVATION]: Phi_6(x) = x^2 - x + 1 iterated from 2 gives {2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3263443, ...} = Sylvester's sequence. Product formula: a_{n+1} = a_1*...*a_n + 1. Terms are pairwise coprime. Connection is exact.

2. **Egyptian fraction of unity** [THEOREM]: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/43 + ... = 1. Physical terms (up to Im_O=7) give 41/42. Remainder = 1/42 = 1/(dim_C * Im_H * Im_O). The division algebra cascade values partition unity via reciprocals.

3. **Band exclusivity of cascade values** [CONJECTURE]: Pure Phi_6 values as full denominators map to unique bands: {3,7} -> D, {43} -> B, {111} -> C, {1807+} -> absent. Deeper cascade -> finer band. Gap gradient: 1500 ppm -> 2.8 ppm -> 0.27 ppm.

4. **Physics termination** [OBSERVATION]: 1807 = 13*139 and 12211 (prime) appear nowhere in the framework -- not as denominators, numerators, or factors. Physics extends ONE Phi_6 step beyond Hurwitz, then stops.

5. **Structural depth D(den) is NOT a standalone predictor** [OBSERVATION]: Spearman rho = +0.34 (wrong sign vs hypothesis). v/M_Koide (D=0, Band C) and alpha_s (D=4, Band A) spoil the correlation. But D=3 (cyclotomic) -> Band B/C exclusively (100% purity). Depth is a co-predictor with sector, not a replacement.

6. **Total depth D(num)+D(den) anti-correlates with gap** [CONJECTURE]: Spearman rho = -0.371. The combined algebraic complexity of numerator and denominator weakly predicts precision.

7. **Beta function ladder** [OBSERVATION]: b_0(N_f=0) = 11 = n_c, b_0(N_f=3) = 9 = Im_H^2, b_0(N_f=6) = 7 = Im_O. Standard QCD beta coefficients at "natural" flavor counts equal division algebra numbers.

8. **Strong dressing untestable** [OBSERVATION]: All 6 Band D gaps have sigma < 1. C_s coefficients cannot be extracted with current data precision.

## Scripts

| Script | Tests | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `verification/sympy/phi6_cascade_formalization.py` | 32/32 | PASS |
| `verification/sympy/structural_depth_measure.py` | 19/22 | PARTIAL |
| `verification/sympy/strong_dressing_paradigm.py` | 21/21 | PASS |

Total: **72/75 PASS** (96%)

Q2 FAILs (3): Spearman rho positive (not negative) for D(den); EM-only rho positive; avg D(den) for Band C not > Band D. All three are honest negative results about the depth measure's limitations.

## Open Questions

1. **Egyptian fraction physical interpretation** (EQ-039 extension): 1/2+1/3+1/7=41/42 partitions unity. Does 42 = dim_C*Im_H*Im_O have a physical meaning beyond being the product? Is the "unaccounted 1/42" related to the beyond-Hurwitz physics?
2. **Refined depth measure**: D(den) alone fails. Can we define a better measure that captures BOTH cascade depth AND trace structure? Perhaps: D_eff = D(den) + bonus for End(V)-trace involvement?
3. **Sylvester sequence and Cayley-Dickson**: The identification Phi_6 cascade = Sylvester = Cayley-Dickson is deep. Is there a representation-theoretic proof that the cyclotomic polynomial Phi_6 controls the dimension growth of division algebras?
4. **b_0 ladder experimental test**: b_0(N_f=6)=Im_O is verifiable via lattice QCD running at different N_f values. Are the N_f=0, 3, 6 beta coefficients more precisely matched than general N_f?

## Key Context for Next Session

Phi_6 cascade formalized as Sylvester's sequence with Egyptian fraction property (1/2+1/3+1/7+...=1). Band exclusivity of cascade denominators confirmed (32/32 PASS). Structural depth measure partially works: cyclotomic D=3 -> B/C exclusively, but D(den) alone doesn't anti-correlate with gap (3 FAIL). Total depth weakly anti-correlates (rho=-0.37). Strong dressing untestable (all sigma < 1). Beta ladder b_0 = {11, 9, 7} at N_f = {0, 3, 6} is notable.

72/75 PASS (3 scripts). No propagation triggers.
