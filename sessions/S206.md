# Session 206: Crystallization Catalog v2.0

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog expansion and improvement
**Topic**: Casimir / crystallization (cross-cutting)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S205 (claims audit), S169 (last catalog update)

---

## Outcome

Major expansion of `framework/CRYSTALLIZATION_CATALOG.md` from v1.1 (S169) to v2.0, incorporating 37 sessions of work (S170-S206). No new crystallization types (C10+) warranted — all post-S169 developments fit within the existing C1-C9 taxonomy.

## Key Changes

### Type Entry Updates

1. **C2 (SSB)**: Added Eigenvalue Selection Theorem (S168) — b₂ sign determines SM gauge group, (3,1) partition gives U(3)×U(1). Added 3 new verification scripts (70/70 PASS). Coset resolved as Gr(4,11) = 28 Goldstones = 4(Higgs) + 24(pNGBs).

2. **C4 (Born Rule)**: Major confidence upgrade — noise structure now derived from Fubini-Study geometry (CR-035 resolved, S169). Removed [A-PHYSICAL] assumption. Added 3 new verification scripts (40/40 PASS). Entanglement correlations verified as THEOREM (Bell/CHSH = 2√2).

3. **C6 (Casimir/QCD)**: Added beta coefficient decomposition (S163) — all 3 SM one-loop beta coefficients equal framework numbers exactly, zero free parameters. Grade A-. Added 3 new verification scripts. Added sin²θ_W(eff) = 28/121 to observables.

4. **C7 (Cosmo phases)**: Documented CC wrong sign as F-10 (FALSIFIED). Added l₂ resolution via baryon loading (phi_odd = 3/11, 0.4%). Documented η* and c_s falsifications from S198.

### New Part V Sections

5. **Section 5.6**: Entanglement as Crystallization Mechanism — CANONICAL, 9 scripts, 113/113 PASS. Not a new type but foundational mechanism for C4. Tensor product derived. Bell/CHSH at Tsirelson bound. 7-qubit dimensional cap predicted.

6. **Section 5.7**: EWSB as Crystallization — [DERIVATION] for Higgs quantum numbers, [CONJECTURE] for pNGB mechanism. Eigenvalue partition (3,1) directly gives EWSB.

7. **Section 5.8**: Collider Validation Summary — 5-phase program, Phases I/III/IV done. 18 Z-pole observables compared. Pattern: structural [DERIVATION], numerical [CONJECTURE].

### Additional Type Updates (continuation)

8. **C8 (Emission)**: Upgraded confidence to [DERIVATION] for 1/N_I mechanism with five independent democracy arguments. DE-009 resolution documented. Step 5 grade D+ → C-. Gaussian convention derivation noted.

9. **C9 (Mass Freezing)**: Full Phase 4 audit results (S188-190) incorporated. Added mass formula examples (m_p/m_e, y_t, Koide Q, m_H). Honest assessment: structural [DERIVATION], numerical [CONJECTURE], main terms discovered post-hoc. 4 verification scripts now referenced.

### Composability & Index Updates

10. **Part III chains**: Added 3 new chains (Entangled Measurement, EWSB, Collider Process). Added 3 new special relationships.
11. **Verification table**: 28 → 49 scripts, ~369 → ~530+ tests
12. **Gap tracker**: 3 items resolved, 3 items falsified, 3 new HIGH gaps added (b₂<0, n_c/Im_H mechanism, Ω_m)
13. **Observable index**: Added 6 new entries (sin²θ_W(eff), Bell/CHSH, b₀, b₁, l₂, CC falsified)
14. **Common Questions**: Added 5 new entries (entanglement, Higgs, collider, generations, beta functions)
15. **Session history**: Extended through S206 (8 new entries)

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `framework/CRYSTALLIZATION_CATALOG.md` | v1.1 → v2.0 (976 → 1184 lines, +21% content) |
| `sessions/INDEX.md` | Added S206 entry |
| `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` | Registered/deregistered S206 |

## Open Questions

1. Should entanglement become C10 in a future revision? Currently classified as C4 mechanism, but the 113-test CANONICAL investigation is substantial.
2. The n_c/Im_H gauge self-coupling mechanism remains the highest-priority unexplained pattern (all beta coefficients depend on it).
3. No new verification scripts were written this session — all updates reference existing scripts from S161-S204.
4. C5 (Black Holes) had no new developments to incorporate — remains STABLE at [CONJECTURE].

## Key Context for Next Session

The catalog is now current through S206 at 1184 lines. All 9 types (C1-C9) are updated, with 3 composability chains added, 3 cross-cutting sections (5.6-5.8), and a fully refreshed gap tracker. The C1-C9 taxonomy is assessed as complete — no new types warranted. Next session could focus on: n_c/Im_H mechanism (highest gap priority), mass scale f derivation, Step 5 alpha mechanism strengthening, or collider Phase II/V work.
