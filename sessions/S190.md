# Session 190 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: Phase 4D: Collider phenomenology audit (EWSB, beta functions, CW potential)
**Topic**: Particle physics audit (`topics/collider-crystallization.md`)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S189 (Phase 4C: Mixing angles)
**Next**: Phase 5 (Cosmology) or Phase 6 (Gravity)

---

## Outcome

Phase 4D DONE. All three collider phenomenology domains audited with full assumption classifications. EWSB: Higgs quantum numbers genuinely [DERIVATION] from tilt matrix decomposition (grade B+). Beta coefficients: one-loop [DERIVATION] grade A- (clean, exact, zero free parameters), two-loop [CONJECTURE] grade C (CR-048 confirmed). CW potential: grade D+ (three independent conjectures, π² cancellation clever but unmotivated). New derivations_summary section 1.30b created for CW/Higgs mass.

---

## Key Findings

1. **EWSB is the framework's second-best collider result** [S190-AUDIT]: Higgs quantum numbers (2,1)_{Y=1/2} are genuinely derived from ε_di decomposition (Steps 1-4). The pNGB mechanism (Step 5) is a reasonable [CONJECTURE]. b₂<0 from AXM_0117 is the weakest link (qualitative). Overall grade B+.

2. **Beta coefficient one-loop is the strongest collider result** [S190-AUDIT]: Framework quantities (n_c/Im_H, n_d/Im_H) substitute exactly into SM beta functions with zero free parameters. 11/3 = n_c/Im_H and 4/3 = n_d/Im_H are exact identities. Grade A-. Mechanism (WHY) remains open.

3. **CW potential has three independent conjectures** [S190-AUDIT]: c_β = π²/6 (unmotivated), y_t = 1 (reasonable), ξ = n_d/n_c² (no vacuum alignment). The π² cancellation yielding λ = N_c/24 = 1/O via N_c×O=24 is structurally interesting. λ_H = 125/968 (0.2% match) has look-elsewhere ~8%. Grade D+.

4. **Pattern confirmation**: Collider phenomenology follows the same pattern as rest of framework — structural relationships are [DERIVATION], numerical predictions rest on [CONJECTURE], mechanisms remain open.

## Phase 4 Complete Summary

| Phase | Sessions | Grade Range | Pattern |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| 4A (Alpha chain) | S187 | A- to C | 13/17 derived, Step 5 weakest |
| 4B (Mass formulas) | S188 | B+ to C- | Corrections defensible, main terms post-hoc |
| 4C (Mixing angles) | S189 | A to D | CKM/PMNS all [CONJECTURE], theta_QCD downgraded |
| 4D (Collider) | S190 | A- to D+ | Structural [DERIVATION], numerical [CONJECTURE] |

**Phase 4 is COMPLETE.** All particle physics derivations now have full assumption classifications.

## Open Questions

1. **WHY n_c/Im_H?**: The gauge self-coupling factor 11/3 = n_c/Im_H is exact, but no mechanism explains why gauge fields probe crystal directions per quaternionic channel. This is the top open question in collider physics.

2. **CW form factor c_β**: Deriving c_β = π²/6 from SO(11) dynamics would upgrade the Higgs mass prediction from D+ to B+.

3. **Vacuum alignment**: Deriving ξ = n_d/n_c² from a vacuum alignment mechanism would close a major gap.

## Key Context for Next Session

**Phase 4 (Particle Physics Audit) is COMPLETE.** Per the master plan, the next phases are:
- **Phase 5 (Cosmology Cleanup)**: Honest assessment, inflation, dark matter, BBN — 6-9 sessions
- **Phase 6 (Gravity Assessment)**: "Honest ceiling C- at best" — 4-5 sessions
- **Phase 7 (Statistical Validation)**: Formula search documentation, LLM challenge — 7-10 sessions
- **Phase 8 (Falsification Completion)**: 3-4 sessions

Phases 5/6 can run in parallel. Phase 7 depends on Phases 4/5/6 being complete.
