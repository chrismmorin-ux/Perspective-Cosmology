# Session 253: CCP + Pipeline Framework Integration (Priority 2)

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Focus**: Propagate S251 foundational results through Priority 2 files (alpha investigations, core theorems, layer files)
**Previous**: S252 (Priority 1 — 13 files)
**Status**: COMPLETE (Priority 2)

---

## Outcome

Systematic propagation of AXM_0120 (CCP) across all Priority 2 files. Every [A-STRUCTURAL] tag on F=C, and every [A-IMPORT] tag on n_d=4, n_c=11 in alpha investigation files and layer overview files has been upgraded to [DERIVED from CCP]. Layer files updated with CCP notes, Pipeline reference, and generation count. Layer 2 "critical insight" (axioms constrain nothing) corrected — CCP now forces dim=11, F=C, n_d=4.

---

## Key Findings

1. **[PROPAGATION] 9 files updated across 4 directories**. Alpha investigations (5 files), core theorems (1), layer files (3). All CCP-resolvable [A-STRUCTURAL]/[A-IMPORT] tags upgraded.

2. **[CLARIFICATION] Independence assumption kept as [A-STRUCTURAL]**. The "sum not product" assumption (defect + crystal contribute additively) is from P1 orthogonal decomposition, NOT from CCP. Lines 319/478 in tilt_matrix and line 110 in alpha_formula_derivations correctly kept as [A-STRUCTURAL].

3. **[UPDATE] Layer 2 "critical insight" corrected**. The original claim that "axioms constrain almost nothing numerically" is now outdated — CCP forces dim=11, F=C, n_d=4. Updated with strikethrough and correction.

4. **[UPDATE] Layer 2 progress table expanded**. Added CCP derivation paths for F=C, n_c=11. Added Pipeline (second SM gauge group route). Added generation count = 3. Updated honest conclusion from "conditional derivation" to "substantial derivation from CCP".

5. **[UPDATE] Layer 3 derivation chain rewritten**. CCP now at root instead of T1 + [A-DIV]. Pipeline added. Generation count added. Note: [A-COUPLING] still required for Weinberg angle.

## Files Modified (9 total)

### Alpha Investigation Files (5 files)
| File | Key Changes |
|------|-------------|
| `framework/investigations/alpha/tilt_matrix_alpha_derivation.md` | Lines 77-79, 286, 467, 473-474, 489-491: F=C, n_d, n_c -> [D: CCP]. Open Q1, Q7 resolved. |
| `framework/investigations/alpha/alpha_crystal_interface.md` | Lines 15-19, 316-324, 326, 357-358: imports + derivation chain + status table. Q1, Q4 resolved. |
| `framework/investigations/alpha/alpha_formula_derivations.md` | Lines 65, 109-110, 172-174, 186: F=C -> [D: CCP], n1/n2 -> [D: CCP]. Summary table updated. |
| `framework/investigations/alpha/alpha_correction_derivation.md` | Line 58: [A1] n_c=11 -> [D: CCP]. |
| `framework/investigations/alpha/mode_sector_decomposition.md` | Added S253 CCP note in Background section. |

### Core Theorems (1 file)
| File | Key Changes |
|------|-------------|
| `core/theorems/THM_04A2_single_photon_tilt.md` | Step 1: added AXM_0120 alongside AXM_0118. Dependencies table: added AXM_0120. |

### Layer Files (3 files)
| File | Key Changes |
|------|-------------|
| `framework/layer_1_crystallization.md` | S253 CCP note: stable configs {1,2,4,8} forced by CCP. |
| `framework/layer_2_correspondence.md` | S253 note (CCP + Pipeline + Generations). "Critical insight" corrected. I-DIM-1 classification updated. Progress table expanded. Honest conclusion upgraded. |
| `framework/layer_3_predictions.md` | S253 note. Assumption table: [A-DIV] subsumed by CCP. Derivation chain rewritten with CCP at root. [A-DIV] gap section updated. |

## Scripts

No new verification scripts this session (propagation-only work; no new calculations).

---

## Open Questions

1. **Priority 3 propagation**: ~25 files in particle physics, gauge theory, quantum, cosmology investigations still have CCP-relevant tags. Most are subsidiary (not directly n_c/n_d/F=C). Estimated 2-3 sessions.
2. **Priority 4 (publications)**: HONEST_ASSESSMENT, TECHNICAL_SUMMARY, THESIS need assumption count updates.
3. **Priority 5 (topic files)**: topics/weinberg-angle.md, topics/step5-alpha-mechanism.md, etc.
4. **Layer 0 already done** — confirmed Section 20 (CCP meta-axiom) and Section 22 (resolved parameters) were added in S251/S252.

## Key Context for Next Session

S253 completed Priority 2 propagation. The alpha investigation files (tilt_matrix, crystal_interface, formula_derivations, correction, mode_sector) and all four layer overview files now reflect CCP. The remaining [A-STRUCTURAL] tags in these files are genuinely non-CCP-resolvable (independence/additivity from P1, coupling structure, linear coupling form). Priority 3 targets ~25 files in particle physics, gauge theory, quantum, and cosmology investigations. Priority 4 is publications. The framework's remaining irreducible assumptions are: (1) [A-COUPLING] (gauge coupling scaling), (2) [A-PHYSICAL] identifications (interface=1/alpha, generations=Im(H)), (3) linear coupling form [A-STRUCTURAL], (4) |Pi| unconstrained.
