# Session S339: DM Identity — det-Tr Decoupling Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Rigorous analysis of det-Tr decoupling claim from S335; DM carrier identification
**Outcome**: S335 det-Tr S_4 character argument RETRACTED; DM identity confirmed GENUINELY OPEN

---

## Key Findings

### 1. S_4 Character Argument RETRACTED [THEOREM]

The S335 claim that det and Tr have "different S_4 characters" (sign rep vs trivial rep) used the WRONG group action:
- **Row permutation** (M -> PM): det is sign rep, Tr is not even a rep — NON-PHYSICAL
- **Conjugation** (M -> PMP^{-1}): BOTH det and Tr are trivial rep — PHYSICAL

Under the physically relevant conjugation action, there is no S_4 distinction between det and Tr.

### 2. First-Order Proportionality [THEOREM]

At the democratic vacuum M = cI (c = n_c - 1 = 10):
```
delta(det) = c^3 * delta(Tr) = 1000 * delta(Tr)
```
The det and Tr fluctuations are PROPORTIONAL at first order. det becomes independent only at second order through sigma_2(delta_lambda).

### 3. Schur's Lemma Higgs-Eaten Decoupling [THEOREM]

At M = cI, the S_4 symmetry forces the Hessian into block-diagonal form:
- Trivial rep (1-dim): Higgs mode (mass^2 = a)
- Standard rep (3-dim): Eaten Goldstones (mass^2 = b, 3-fold degenerate)

This decoupling is exact by Schur's lemma — but it separates Higgs from eaten Goldstones, NOT DM from Higgs.

### 4. Complete DOF Accounting [THEOREM]

All 28 pNGBs identified:
- 4 color singlets = Higgs doublet (1 Higgs + 3 eaten)
- 24 colored = scalar leptoquarks + diquarks (~1.76 TeV)
- Zero DOFs remain for a "det mode" particle

### 5. det(M) = Scale, Not Particle

det(M) determines a mass SCALE (5.11 GeV) from the coupling matrix, analogous to 't Hooft's det(m_f) in QCD instanton physics. It is a nonlinear function of the 4 eigenvalue modes, not an independent degree of freedom.

## Retractions

| Claim | Origin | Retraction Reason |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| det-Tr "different S_4 characters" | S335 | Wrong group action (row perm, not conjugation) |
| det(M) mode as DM particle | S335 | Not an independent DOF; all 28 pNGBs accounted for |
| det-Tr orthogonality as sigma_SI | S335 | delta(det) = c^3 * delta(Tr) at first order |

## New Theorems

| Result | Type |
|--------|------|
| Both det and Tr are trivial rep under S_4 conjugation | [THEOREM] |
| delta(det) = c^3 * delta(Tr) at democratic vacuum | [THEOREM] |
| Schur's lemma Hessian block-diagonalization | [THEOREM] |
| Complete pNGB DOF accounting (28 = 4+24) | [THEOREM] |

## Open Questions

1. **nu_R mass mechanism**: Can det(M) scale connect to a nu_R Dirac mass?
2. **DM stability**: What symmetry protects the lightest candidate from decay?
3. **Orphan prediction**: Should P-002 be maintained, downgraded, or restructured?
4. **New sectors**: Are there framework DOFs beyond pNGB + spinor that could host 5 GeV?

## Key Context for Next Session

The DM identity is now GENUINELY OPEN with the strongest possible grounding — every candidate has been systematically evaluated and either ruled out or found speculative. The mass formula and Omega ratio survive as structural predictions but lack a carrier particle. The most promising direction is nu_R from the spinor sector, but this requires a mass mechanism and stability argument that don't yet exist. This is an honest gap, well-documented.
