# Session S302: IRA-10 Redundancy — "Perspectives = QM" Is Derived

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: IRA-10 redundancy: does "perspectives = quantum states" follow from derived theorems?
**Topic**: Irreducible assumptions (`framework/IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md`)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S299 (IRA-08/09 resolution), S292 (CONJ-A1)
**Next**: See open questions

---

## Outcome

**IRA-10 RESOLVED**. "Perspectives = quantum states" is a forced recognition, not an assumption. All 7 defining properties of quantum mechanics are derived from Layer 0/1 axioms WITHOUT invoking IRA-10. The Weinberg criterion (same mechanism as IRA-08/09 in S299) forces the identification. IRA count **6 -> 5**. The [A-INTERPRETATION] tier is **ELIMINATED entirely**.

---

## Key Findings

1. **All 7 QM properties derived without IRA-10** [VERIFICATION]: Traced dependency chains for Hilbert space (THM_0491), Born rule (THM_0494), unitarity (THM_0493), complex amplitudes (THM_0485), non-commutativity (S108), uncertainty (S108), quantized spectra (S109). None invoke IRA-10. Zero out of seven.

2. **Finite dimensionality already derived** [THM_0491, CANONICAL]: The CONJ-A1 crux ("does C5 + IRA-10 -> finite H?") is moot because THM_0491 Step 2 already derives dim(V_pi) < infinity from AXM_0113 (finite access), without IRA-10. Combined with C5 (|I| finite) and CCP (framework = complete theory), dim(H_phys) < infinity follows. The updated CONJ-A1 chain is STRONGER: rests on CANONICAL theorem instead of [A-INTERPRETATION].

3. **Weinberg criterion forces identification** [DERIVATION via Weinberg]: V_pi has all 7 defining QM properties. No QM-inconsistent properties. Three alternative interpretations rejected (classical, statistical, non-quantum informational). By the same criterion used for IRA-08 (S299: "eps is ONLY DOF") and IRA-09 (S299: "3 copies = generations"), the identification is forced.

4. **IRA-10 reduces to IRA-06 + IRA-07 + theorems**: The physical content of "perspectives = QM" decomposes into: (a) "measurement = crystallization" which is IRA-06, (b) "directed evolution = dynamics" which is IRA-07, (c) "V_pi has QM structure" which is THM_0491/0494/0493/0485 (all derived). No residual content remains.

5. **[A-INTERPRETATION] tier eliminated**: The framework now has ZERO interpretive assumptions. The 5 remaining IRAs are: 2 [A-STRUCTURAL] (IRA-01: kappa=1, IRA-04: quartic ratio), 2 [A-PHYSICAL] (IRA-06: SSB, IRA-07: time — both Weinberg-forced), 1 [A-IMPORT] (IRA-11: |Pi| scale).

6. **5 adversarial objections addressed**: (1) Single vs total Hilbert space — C5 bounds dim(V). (2) Born rule [A-PHYSICAL] — reduces to IRA-06, not IRA-10. (3) Missing 8th QM property — standard Dirac-von Neumann axioms complete. (4) Weinberg subjectivity — same standard as all physical identifications. (5) CONJ-A1 dependency — chain holds with THM_0491 replacing IRA-10.

## Derivation Chain

```
IRA-06 (crystallization = SSB) [A-PHYSICAL, already on list]
  -> measurement = crystallization to pure state
  -> physical interpretation of Born rule (THM_0494)

IRA-07 (adjacency = time) [A-PHYSICAL, already on list]
  -> directed evolution -> complex amplitudes (THM_0485)
  -> unitary dynamics (THM_0493)

THM_0491 (V_pi is Hilbert space) [CANONICAL, from AXM_0109/0110/0113 + THM_0485]
THM_0494 (Born rule) [DERIVATION]
THM_0493 (Unitary evolution) [DERIVATION]
THM_0485 (F = C) [CANONICAL]
+ Non-commutativity [DERIVATION, S108]
+ Uncertainty relations [DERIVATION, S108]
+ Quantized spectra [DERIVATION, S109]

= All 7 QM properties present, 0 inconsistencies, 0 alternatives

Weinberg criterion [META-PRINCIPLE, same as S299]
  -> IRA-10 RESOLVED: perspectives = QM is recognition, not assumption
```

## IRA Inventory After S302

| ID | Type | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| IRA-01 | [A-STRUCTURAL] | Active | kappa=1 (S297) |
| IRA-04 | [A-STRUCTURAL] | Active (LOW) | Ratio rho (S298) |
| IRA-06 | [A-PHYSICAL] | Active, Weinberg-forced | Crystallization = SSB |
| IRA-07 | [A-PHYSICAL] | Active, Weinberg-forced | Adjacency = time |
| IRA-11 | [A-IMPORT] | Active | |Pi| ~ 10^118 |
| **Total** | | **5** | Down from 6 (IRA-10 resolved) |

Type distribution: 0 conjectures, 2 structural, 2 physical, 0 interpretation, 1 import.

## Open Questions

1. **IRA-06/07 further reduction?** The "moderate view" from S299 (Weinberg criterion subsumes both into 1 meta-assumption) would give total IRA = 4. Philosophical, not technical.
2. **IRA-01 further resolution?** kappa=1 is a mathematical convention (standard Tr), not a physical assumption. Could it be argued as definitional? Would reduce to 4.
3. **IRA-11 bounds?** Can |Pi| be bounded from internal consistency rather than imported from observation?

## Key Context for Next Session

IRA count now 5 (was 6). The [A-INTERPRETATION] sector has been eliminated entirely — the framework has ZERO interpretive assumptions. All QM structure (Hilbert space, Born rule, unitarity, complex amplitudes, non-commutativity, uncertainty, quantization) is derived from Layer 0/1 axioms. The remaining 5 IRAs are well-characterized and compact: 2 structural conventions (both LOW-to-MEDIUM impact), 2 Weinberg-forced physical identifications (irreducible at the meta-level), and 1 cosmological import. The CONJ-A1 chain is strengthened by replacing IRA-10 with THM_0491 [CANONICAL]. Next high-value targets: IRA-01 analysis (is kappa=1 definitional?), new physics topics (LLM v3, Yang-Mills extensions), or documentation/propagation work.
