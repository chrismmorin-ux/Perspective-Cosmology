# Session 224: Democratic Counting from Schur's Lemma — Irreducibility Resolution

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Democratic counting mechanism: why 1/g² = dim(manifold) (EQ-007)
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S222 (two-regime structural theorem)

## Outcome

The "why democratic not Dynkin?" gap (open since S215) is largely resolved via **Schur's lemma applied to the irreducible tangent space** of the vacuum manifold [DERIVATION]. The tangent space Hom(R⁴, R⁷) of Gr(4,11) is an irreducible representation of the isotropy group SO(4)×SO(7) (tensor product of vector irreps). By Schur's lemma, the HS metric (AXM_0110) restricted to this space is the **unique** invariant bilinear form — all 28 directions have equal weight. Dynkin weighting is excluded because there is only one irreducible component (no different reps to weight differently). Same argument for SU(3): adjoint of simple Lie algebra is irreducible → Killing form treats all 8 generators equally.

Gap narrowed from "why democratic?" to one specific physical assumption [A-PHYSICAL]: emergent gauge fields inherit the vacuum manifold metric (gauge coupling not a separate free parameter). RG tension documented: SM-only running gives inconsistent scales (Λ₂ ≈ 2100 GeV vs Λ₃ ≈ 140 GeV).

## Key Findings

### 1. Democratic Metric from Schur's Lemma [DERIVATION]

**Derivation chain**:
1. End(V) has HS inner product ⟨A,B⟩ = (1/n_c)Tr(A†B) → flat metric on R^{121} [A: AXM_0110]
2. Vacuum manifold Gr(4,11), tangent space = Hom(R⁴, R⁷) [D: Layer 1]
3. R⁴ ⊗ R⁷ is **irreducible** under SO(4)×SO(7) [D: tensor product of irreps of independent groups]
4. **Schur's lemma**: unique invariant bilinear form → (1/n_c)×I_{28×28} [D]
5. All 28 tangent directions metrically equal → **DEMOCRATIC** [D]

**Why Dynkin is excluded**: Dynkin indices weight different irreducible components of a *reducible* decomposition. For an *irreducible* space, there is only one component — Schur's lemma permits only one scale factor. Under SU(2)_L, the 28 modes decompose into 14 doublets (T_Dynkin = 7), but this is a finer resolution within an already-fixed metric. The metric was determined at the SO(4)×SO(7) level.

### 2. Same Argument for SU(3)

su(3) is the adjoint of simple SU(3) → irreducible under Ad(SU(3)). Killing form K(T_a, T_b) = c × δ_{ab} is the unique invariant form. All 8 generators equal. Democratic counting 1/g₃² ∝ 8.

### 3. Tree-Level Coupling Predictions

| Coupling | Democratic Value | Measured at M_Z | RG Factor | Delta |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| 1/α₂ | 28 | 29.585 | 1.0566 | 5.66% |
| 1/α₃ | 8 | 8.482 | 1.0602 | 6.02% |
| 1/α_EM | 121 | 127.955 | 1.0575 | 5.75% |

RG factors spread: 0.36% relative. Notable similarity but does NOT follow from SM one-loop running with a single scale.

### 4. RG Consistency Tension

SM one-loop running from tree-level values gives inconsistent crystallization scales:
- From SU(2): Λ ≈ 2100 GeV
- From SU(3): Λ ≈ 140 GeV

Ratio 15:1. The framework requires non-perturbative matching, BSM thresholds, or more nuanced "tree-level" definition. Status: OPEN TENSION.

## Open Questions

1. **Emergent gauge coupling** (EQ-007 residual): The [A-PHYSICAL] assumption in Step 6 — do gauge fields inherit the vacuum manifold metric? This is the framework's distinguishing claim vs standard QFT. Could be formalized as a new axiom or derived from the composite Higgs structure.
2. **RG matching** (NEW): Why are the three RG correction factors so similar (~0.34% spread) when SM beta coefficients differ by factors of ~2? Non-perturbative matching at crystallization scale?
3. **Overall normalization** (EQ-003): Why is the proportionality constant κ = 1 (so 1/g² = N exactly, not just ∝ N)? Related to Step 5 alpha mechanism.
4. **Singlet criterion derivation**: Can the singlet criterion (S222) be derived from axioms rather than observed? (The Schur's lemma argument doesn't address this.)

## Key Context for Next Session

S224 provided a mathematical derivation [DERIVATION] for democratic counting: Schur's lemma on the irreducible tangent space of the vacuum manifold. The "why democratic not Dynkin?" question (open since S215, across 6 sessions) is answered: the tangent space is irreducible, so Schur's lemma forces a unique metric with equal weights. The remaining gap is one physical assumption [A-PHYSICAL]: gauge fields are emergent and inherit the vacuum manifold metric. RG tension exists but is not fatal. 21/21 PASS.
