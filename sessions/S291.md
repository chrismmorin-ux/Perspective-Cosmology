# Session 291: Planck's Constant — H₂ Topological Correction

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Planck constant: EQ-038 topological step — H₂ correction
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/constants/planck_constant_investigation.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S278 (mu=0 locus + Schubert partial)

## Outcome

**MAJOR CORRECTION**: H₂(Gr⁺(4,11;R);Z) = Z/2, not Z. The investigation's symplectic structure (Parts VII, X) was based on an error — confusing the real Grassmannian with the complex one. Four results retracted, twelve survive. The correct global structure is quaternion-Kähler (Wolf space), with 7 quaternionic pairs = Im_O replacing 14 symplectic pairs.

## Key Findings

1. **H₂(Gr⁺(4,11;R);Z) = Z/2** [THEOREM]: Via long exact homotopy sequence of SO(4)×SO(7) → SO(11) → Gr⁺. π₂ = ker(i_*: Z/2×Z/2 → Z/2) = Z/2. By Hurewicz (π₁=0).

2. **b₂ = 0, H²(Gr⁺;Z) = 0** [THEOREM]: No integral or real 2-cohomology exists. By UCT.

3. **ω_I ⊗ g₇ not globally defined** [THEOREM]: SO(4) conjugation sends J_I → A^T J_I A, rotating among {J_I, J_J, J_K}. Not K-invariant. Verified explicitly.

4. **Level alpha = 2 RETRACTED**: No integral 2-class exists. The computation was valid locally but has no topological meaning.

5. **chi(Gr⁺(4,11;R)) = 20 = n_d(n_c-1)/2** [THEOREM]: Via Weyl group orders |W(B₅)|/(|W(D₂)|·|W(B₃)|) = 3840/192 = 20. Also = C(2·Im_H, Im_H).

6. **Betti numbers**: P(t) = 1 + 2t⁴ + 3t⁸ + 4t¹² + 4t¹⁶ + 3t²⁰ + 2t²⁴ + t²⁸. b₄ = 2 (generators: p₁, e).

7. **Quaternion-Kähler 4-form Ω₄ = ω_I²+ω_J²+ω_K²**: IS globally defined (K-invariant). 7 quaternionic pairs = dim(Gr)/4 = Im_O. More natural for H-based framework.

8. **k = 2 is special**: For k=2, π₁(SO(2)) = Z (not Z/2), giving H₂ = Z and a genuine symplectic structure. For k ≥ 3 including k = n_d = 4, H₂ = Z/2 always.

9. **12/17 results survive**: All local computations (mu=0 locus, G₂ moment map, Killing form, volume defect) are unaffected. Only global symplectic claims retracted.

## Open Questions

1. **Quaternion-Kähler quantization** (EQ-038 successor): Can ∫ Ω₄⁷ / normalization give integer state counts? Uses b₄ = 2 and H₄(Gr⁺;Z) ⊃ Z².
2. **Oriented vs unoriented chi**: chi(Gr⁺) = 20 vs C(11,4) = 330. Does this affect the Vol ~ chi near-miss?
3. **Plan revision**: Avenues 2 (|Pi| count) and 5 (running count) from the S285-S291 plan need revision — symplectic quantization assumed. Avenues 4 (D), 6 (0.95%), and 3 (h-YM) are unaffected.

## Key Context for Next Session

The h investigation is corrected and remains CANONICAL. The topological correction removes 4 results (symplectic form, 14 pairs, level alpha=2, symplectic |Pi|) but preserves 12 and adds a better replacement: quaternion-Kähler structure with 7 quaternionic pairs = Im_O. The key new insight: k ≥ 3 cannot be symplectic (π₁(SO(k)) = Z/2, not Z). The correct quantization framework uses the degree-4 Pontryagin/Euler classes with b₄ = 2.

**For the plan**: Avenues 3, 4, 6 proceed unchanged. Avenue 1 is DONE (different conclusion). Avenues 2 and 5 need fundamental rethinking — replace symplectic quantization with quaternion-Kähler quantization. This is actually a more interesting mathematical problem.
