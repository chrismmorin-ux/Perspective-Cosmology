# Session 166 — 2026-01-31

**Focus**: Collider dynamics Phase IV (Higgs branching) + vacuum polarization mechanism
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S163 (Phases I-III)

## Outcome

Executed Phase IV of collider data validation (Higgs branching ratios) and pushed the vacuum polarization mechanism analysis deeper. Higgs BRs decompose by crystallization channel with O > H > C hierarchy confirmed, but the framework cannot predict individual branching ratios without fermion masses. CJ-CDV-06 ("bb dominance = O-channel") is PARTIAL. The mechanism analysis revealed a critical finding: the simplest tilt potential Tr(eps^2)^2 has a flat direction — a Tr(eps^4) term is required to break eigenvalue degeneracy and select the SM gauge group from U(4).

## Key Findings

1. **[F12] Higgs channel hierarchy** [DERIVATION]: O-mediated (69.3%) > H-mediated (24.0%) > C-mediated (0.23%) confirmed, mirroring force hierarchy Strong > Weak > EM (14/15 PASS)

2. **[F13] Color factor** [DERIVATION]: N_c = Im_H = 3 trivially confirmed for Higgs quark/lepton ratio (already in THM_04A3, not new)

3. **[F14] 7/12 proximity** [SPECULATION]: Im_O/(Im_O+Im_H+dim_C) = 7/12 = 58.33% vs bb BR = 58.2% (0.2% error). Flagged as NUMEROLOGICAL — bb BR depends on m_b which is not derived.

4. **[F15] CJ-CDV-06 PARTIAL**: Mode counting N_c=3 trivially confirmed. Deeper claim (O-channel structure predicts bb fraction) UNSUPPORTED without mass mechanism.

5. **[F16] Fermion mass prerequisite**: Cannot predict individual Higgs BRs without fermion masses. This is a separate open problem.

6. **[F17] Herm(4) spectrum** [DERIVATION]: 16 = 12 (Goldstone/gauge) + 4 (massive/Higgs). Under SU(4): 15 = 8 + 3 + 3 + 1 (15/15 PASS)

7. **[F18] Flat direction** [DERIVATION]: The Tr(eps^2)^2 potential has a flat direction — all eigenvalue distributions satisfying Tr(eps^2) = a/(2b) are degenerate. Need Tr(eps^4) term to break degeneracy and select gauge group. This is the **eigenvalue selection problem**.

8. **[F19] Democratic mass matrix** [DERIVATION]: At VEV eps_0 = l*I_4, the quadratic Lagrangian is W_quad = (a/2)(Tr(delta))^2. Only the trace mode is massive; all 15 others are massless.

9. **[F20] One-loop counting** [CONJECTURE]: 10 symmetric Herm(n_d) modes + 1 scalar trace = 11 = n_c, divided by Im_H = 3 quaternionic channels, gives -11/3 per gauge DOF. Structural match, not computed from Feynman rules.

## Open Questions

1. **Tr(eps^4) eigenvalue selection**: What ratio b_2/b_1 gives the SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) breaking pattern? Different ratios give different gauge groups. This may be the SELECTION MECHANISM for the SM gauge group.

2. **Feynman rules from W(eps, phi)**: Explicit cubic and quartic vertices needed to compute one-loop diagrams from tilt potential. Currently only counting argument exists.

3. **Why Im_H = 3 in the denominator**: The argument "gauge boson couples through Im_H channels" is informal. Need gauge coupling g to emerge from tilt potential derivatives with explicit 1/Im_H factor.

4. **Fermion mass mechanism**: Individual Higgs BRs and the deeper CJ-CDV-06 claim require deriving m_f from tilt curvature per fermion channel. Long-deferred problem.

## Key Context for Continuation

Session 166 identified the **eigenvalue selection problem** as a critical new finding: the tilt potential needs a Tr(eps^4) term (not just (Tr(eps^2))^2) to break the eigenvalue degeneracy of Herm(4) and produce the SM gauge group. The ratio b_2/b_1 of the two quartic invariants determines which gauge group emerges. This is potentially the mechanism that SELECTS SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) from the space of possible breakings — a major open question in physics. The four open problems (A-D from the mechanism script) provide a clear roadmap for future work on deriving beta function coefficients from first principles rather than just matching them.
