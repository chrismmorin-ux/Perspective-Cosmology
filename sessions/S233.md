# Session 233: Weinberg Angle — Step 6 Formal Adoption + Deeper Derivation

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Formally adopt Step 6 [A-PHYSICAL]; composite sector RG; deeper derivation search
**Topic**: [Weinberg angle](../topics/weinberg-angle.md)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: [S228](S228.md) (emergent coupling + RG matching)
**Next**: Weinberg sum rules from crystallization dynamics; or new topic

## Outcome

All three planned directions completed. **Direction 1**: Step 6 formally adopted as I-STRUCT-5, a Layer 2 correspondence principle. EQ-007/EQ-004/EQ-020/EQ-022 all resolved (modulo [A-PHYSICAL]). **Direction 2**: Composite sector RG analysis shows the deficit (0.36%) is naturally sized (between α_s/(4π) = 0.94% and α_2/(4π) = 0.27%), but top partners and colored pNGBs make it WORSE — resolution must come from non-perturbative matching or vector resonances. f = 1354 GeV is NOT the perturbative matching scale for SU(3). **Direction 3**: Four candidate deeper derivations explored. Full compositeness argument (Weinberg sum rules) is the most promising — narrows gap from "arbitrary physical assumption" to "crystallization dynamics satisfies spectral sum rules."

## Key Findings

1. **I-STRUCT-5 formally adopted** [A-PHYSICAL, Layer 2]: "In the crystallized vacuum on Gr(n_d, n_c), gauge couplings at the compositeness scale are determined by the HS metric restricted to the relevant geometric subspace." Added to Layer 2 import table. Democratic metric [DERIVATION] (Schur's lemma), singlet criterion [CONJECTURE], Step 6 = I-STRUCT-5 [A-PHYSICAL]. One irreducible gap.

2. **4 EQ items resolved**: EQ-007 (democratic counting), EQ-022 (κ=1), EQ-004 (xi=4/121), EQ-020 (mass scale f). All resolved modulo [A-PHYSICAL] I-STRUCT-5.

3. **Composite sector RG: non-perturbative matching is natural** [DERIVATION]: The 0.36% deficit sits between α_s/(4π) = 0.94% and α_2/(4π) = 0.27% — exactly the natural size of one-loop matching corrections. Top partners make the deficit 3.5× worse per N_i. Colored pNGBs also worsen it. Resolution must come from vector resonances or non-perturbative matching at f.

4. **f is NOT the perturbative SU(3) matching scale** [FINDING]: SM running from f to M_Z gives eps_3 = 37.6% (vs measured 6%). This confirms the tree-level values are non-perturbative matching conditions, not perturbative thresholds at a single scale.

5. **Full compositeness argument is the best path to deriving I-STRUCT-5** [INVESTIGATION]: If gauge fields are fully composite (no elementary component), Weinberg sum rules force 1/g² = sigma model metric = democratic counting. The gap narrows from "gauge coupling inherits metric" to "crystallization dynamics satisfies spectral sum rules." Fisher information, holographic, and entropic candidates assessed: partial or dead end.

## Open Questions

1. **Weinberg sum rules from crystallization** (new EQ candidate): Can the crystallization dynamics (AXM_0117) produce a spectral representation satisfying Weinberg sum rules? Would close the gap on I-STRUCT-5 entirely. Long-term theoretical project.
2. **EQ-011 status**: f is now resolved (EQ-020), but V₀ still needs additional mechanism. Does EQ-020 resolution unblock EQ-011?
3. **Singlet criterion promotion**: The singlet criterion (S222) remains [CONJECTURE]. It's used in the derivation chain. Can it be promoted to [DERIVATION]?

## Key Context for Next Session

S233 completed the Weinberg angle derivation chain by formally adopting Step 6 as I-STRUCT-5 [A-PHYSICAL], resolving 4 EQ items, and showing the RG tension is naturally sized (0.36% ~ α_s/(4π)). The composite sector analysis found that top partners and pNGBs make the deficit worse — non-perturbative matching is the natural resolution. The deeper derivation search found the full compositeness argument (Weinberg sum rules) as the most promising path: if crystallization dynamics produces a spectral representation satisfying Weinberg sum rules, I-STRUCT-5 follows. This narrows the gap from "arbitrary physical assumption" to a concrete mathematical question. The Weinberg angle topic is now essentially complete — the derivation chain is finished modulo one well-characterized [A-PHYSICAL], with a clear path to potential future closure.
