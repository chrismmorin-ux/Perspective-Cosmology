# Session S283

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Tree-to-dressed: double-trace mechanism + cos(theta_W) resolution + m_p/m_e three-loop
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S282 (Tree-to-dressed systematic + m_p/m_e coefficient)
**Next**: Band A testable predictions (Belle II m_tau); tree-level sin^2+cos^2 mismatch

---

## Outcome

Resolved three of four open questions from S282. (1) **Double-trace mechanism**: Band C specific, arising from End(V) trace normalization by n_c. All 8 coefficients are framework monomials. Deep identity Phi_6(Im_H) = Im_O connects the cyclotomic structure. (2) **cos(theta_W) CORRECTION**: S279's Band B classification RETRACTED -- actual gap is ~93 ppm (Band A). Tree-level sin^2(28/121) + cos^2(171/194) = 1.008, a -8347 ppm mismatch that prevents clean coefficient extraction. (3) **m_p/m_e C_3**: NEGATIVE RESULT. C_3 ~ 5.7, no clean framework number. 2.0 sigma not statistically significant.

## Key Findings

1. **Double-trace is Band C specific** [CONJECTURE]: The genuine double-trace structure (two non-trivial factors with End(V) trace normalization by n_c) exists ONLY in Band C. Alpha: (12/n_c)*dim_C. m_p/m_e: (Phi_6(Im_O)/n_c)*(n_c/Im_O). Bands A/B have single-monomial coefficients. n_c role differs by band: trace normalization (C), direct suppression (A/B QCD), absent (A/B EW/lepton). All 8 coefficients are monomials in {n_d, n_c, Im_H, Im_O, Phi_6(Im_O), N_colored, dim_C}. 21/21 PASS.

2. **cos(theta_W) = Band A, not Band B** [CORRECTION]: Gap ~93 ppm (PDG 2024 world avg) through 706 ppm (CDF 2022). All 6 m_W scenarios give Band A. S279 classification RETRACTED. Tree-level sin^2 + cos^2 = 1.008 (deficit -8347 ppm from 1) dominates the gap. No clean Band A coefficient. Open question: should cos be derived from sin^2 via sqrt(1 - 28/121) instead? 17/17 PASS.

3. **m_p/m_e C_3 = NEGATIVE RESULT** [SPECULATION, HRS 6]: C_3 ~ 5.7, nearest candidates 6 = dim_C*Im_H (5.6% error) or 5.5 = n_c/2 (3.3%). Neither compelling. 2.0 sigma residual not statistically significant. Alpha has C_3 ~ -0.8 (different sign). No universal three-loop pattern. Monitor for CODATA updates. 17/17 PASS.

4. **Deep identity Phi_6(Im_H) = Im_O** [DERIVATION]: The cyclotomic polynomial Phi_6(x) = x^2 - x + 1 that generates the m_p/m_e coefficient (via Phi_6(7) = 43) also connects Im_H = 3 to Im_O = 7 (since Phi_6(3) = 7). This links quaternionic and octonionic imaginary dimensions through the same algebraic structure appearing in the radiative coefficients.

## Open Questions

1. **Tree-level sin^2+cos^2 mismatch** (EQ-039): Should cos(theta_W) = 171/194 be replaced by sqrt(1-28/121) = sqrt(93)/11 to restore the trigonometric identity? If so, what's the origin of 171/194?
2. **Band A testable predictions** (EQ-039): m_tau/m_mu gap = 70 ppm with C = 1/33 (Belle II ~2027). alpha_s gap = 211 ppm with C = 1/n_c (needs lattice 10x improvement).
3. **Coefficient unification principle** (EQ-039): Is there a single principle that selects ALL 8 coefficients, or are they genuinely independent?

## Key Context for Next Session

Tree-to-dressed paradigm is essentially COMPLETE for precision EM/lepton quantities. S283 closed the three main open questions from S282:
- Double-trace: Band C specific, End(V) trace normalization [CONJECTURE, 21/21 PASS]
- cos(theta_W): Band A (corrected from B), tree-level mismatch [CORRECTION, 17/17 PASS]
- C_3 three-loop: negative result, 2.0 sigma not significant [SPECULATION, 17/17 PASS]

Remaining work on this topic: monitoring Band A predictions for future experiments, and the tree-level sin^2+cos^2 mismatch (which may indicate 171/194 should be reconsidered). EQ-039 priority reduced from HIGH to MEDIUM.

55/55 total PASS across 3 scripts.
