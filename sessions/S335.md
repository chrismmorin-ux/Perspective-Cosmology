# Session S335: DM Identity Revision After S328 Corrections

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: DM identity revision + colored pNGB phenomenology + T_X admixture
**Topic**: `framework/investigations/particles/generation_structure.md`
**Status**: Complete
**Previous**: S328 (U(1)_Y embedding), S322 (scalar channel DM), S336 (branching ratios, parallel)

---

## Outcome

Confirmed that the pNGB color singlet = Higgs doublet (zero leftover for DM). DM particle identity is GENUINELY OPEN. Mass formula and Omega ratio survive as structural predictions. sigma_SI = 0 derivation INVALIDATED (was tied to G_2 singlet = Higgs). H-parity scope CLARIFIED (exact for boson-only operators, Yukawa couplings outside scope). Threads 2-3 resolved by parallel session S336.

## Key Findings

1. **pNGB color singlet = Higgs doublet** [THEOREM]: 4 color-singlet pNGBs (one per R^4 direction) exactly fill the Higgs doublet (4 real DOFs). After EWSB: 3 eaten + 1 Higgs = 4. Zero leftover for DM. S322 "DM = pNGB color singlet" RETRACTED.

2. **H-parity maps L_a -> -R_a** [THEOREM]: Explicit computation confirms H-parity (quaternion conjugation P_H = diag(+1,-1,-1,-1)) maps self-dual generators to NEGATIVE anti-self-dual generators (anti-automorphism sign from (qp)* = p*q*). Does NOT commute with either SU(2) factor individually. Since SU(2)_L(SM) = SU(2)_R (S328), H-parity maps gauge generators to broken generators.

3. **H-parity scope clarified** [THEOREM]: The S323 FFT+Euler theorem is CORRECT and EXACT for boson-only operators (all SO(4)-invariant polynomials on Hom(R^4,R^7) have even degree, Gram matrix G = eps^T eps is quadratic, verified symbolically). But Yukawa couplings (eps * psi * psi, degree-1 in eps) are OUTSIDE the FFT scope. H-parity protects the pNGB potential but NOT fermion-mediated processes.

4. **sigma_SI = 0 INVALIDATED** [RETRACTION]: S317 argued "G_2 singlet decouples from Higgs portal." But G_2 singlet pNGB = Higgs. Replacement argument: det(M) and Tr(M) are algebraically independent invariants on End(R^4) with different S_4 characters (sign vs trivial rep), providing structural DM-Higgs decoupling [CONJECTURE].

5. **DM candidate evaluation**: A (pNGB singlet) RULED OUT (= Higgs). B (nu_R) POSSIBLE (gauge singlet, y_nu ~ 0.029). C (composite baryon) RULED OUT (mass ~ 15 TeV). D (skyrmion) RULED OUT (mass ~ 17 TeV). E (sigma scalar) RULED OUT (mass ~ 1.35 TeV). F (det(M) structural mode) OPEN.

6. **What survives S328**: m_DM = 5.11 GeV [DERIVATION], Omega_DM/Omega_b ratio (1.3%) [CONJECTURE], asymmetric DM scenario, colored pNGB mass 1761 GeV [CONJECTURE].

## Retractions

- **S322 Finding**: "DM = scalar channel color singlet" -> **RETRACTED** (= Higgs doublet)
- **S317 Finding**: "sigma_SI = 0 from G_2 singlet decoupling" -> **INVALIDATED** (G_2 singlet = Higgs)
- **S323 Application**: H-parity DM stability -> **SCOPE CLARIFIED** (theorem correct, application to fermion-coupled processes outside scope)

## Open Questions

1. **DM particle identity** (EQ-043): What IS the DM? det(M) structural mode is most promising but needs mechanism. nu_R possible if stability mechanism exists.
2. **det-Tr sigma_SI argument**: Can det(M)-Tr(M) algebraic independence be promoted from [CONJECTURE] to [DERIVATION]?
3. **Colored pNGB Yukawa couplings**: H-parity doesn't forbid them. Do the (2,1/6,3) and (2,-5/6,3) pNGBs have Yukawa couplings, and what are the decay widths?

## Key Context for Next Session

S335 established that the DM identity is a genuine gap in the framework. The mass formula (5.11 GeV) and Omega ratio (1.3%) survive because they're structural (from det(M) on End(R^4)), but we don't know which particle carries this mass. The pNGB sector is fully accounted for: 4 Higgs DOFs + 24 colored scalars = 28. The spinor gives SM fermions, no dark states (S320).

The most promising direction is the det(M) mode: it provides the mass formula, has a different S_4 character from the Tr (Higgs) mode, and naturally decouples from the Higgs portal. The challenge is identifying it with a physical excitation. Options: composite bound state of the strong sector, non-perturbative condensate, or an effective DOF from confining dynamics. This is the key open problem for the DM sector.

H-parity remains an exact symmetry of the pNGB potential (S323 theorem is correct) but its scope is narrower than previously thought: it doesn't constrain Yukawa-mediated processes. Colored pNGBs CAN decay to fermions via Yukawa couplings.
