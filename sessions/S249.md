# Session 249: CNH Phase 3 — Adoption Path, Prediction Strategy, Im_H Derivation

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Focus**: CNH Phase 3 — alternate prediction paths, Im_H derivation, particle physics extension
**Topic**: CNH / prime attractors (continuation of S244, S246, S248)
**Status**: 3 TASKS COMPLETE — no new paths found; gaps confirmed irreducible
**Previous**: S248 (CCF denominator resolution)

---

## Outcome

Systematically searched for alternate prediction paths to satisfy CNH adoption criterion #4 (independent prediction). Found **no viable paths**: CCF does not correlate with nuclear stability (r = -0.15), CNH does not explain magic numbers (28, 126 are non-norms but magic), CNO cycle shows no systematic pattern, and particle physics quantum numbers are trivially all norms. The Im_H = 3 connection is **numerically suggestive but cannot be derived** — the gap is irreducible without specifying nuclear crystallization dynamics. The CNH does NOT extend to particle physics.

---

## Key Findings

1. **[FINDING] No alternate prediction paths for criterion #4**: Searched 5 domains:
   - CCF vs binding energy: r = -0.15 (negligible correlation)
   - Magic numbers: 28 and 126 are non-norms but ARE magic — CNH fails
   - CNO cycle: CCF oscillates both up and down — no systematic pattern
   - Isotope stability (tin series): no correlation with CCF
   - Mixing angles: pattern exists but not testable (classifications, not predictions)

2. **[THEOREM] CCF does not predict nuclear stability**: Pearson correlation between CCF and binding energy per nucleon is r = -0.15 across 25 stable isotopes. The most stable nuclei (Fe-56, Ni-62) have CCF = 1/3, same as Li-7. This is a NEGATIVE result.

3. **[FINDING] CNH fails for magic numbers**: Magic numbers are {2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126}. Of these:
   - norms: 2, 8, 20, 50, 82
   - NON-norms: 28, 126
   CNH would predict non-norm numbers are "crystallization-incompatible", but 28 and 126 are key shell closures (Ca-48, Pb-208 doubly magic).

4. **[IRREDUCIBLE GAP] Im_H = 3 connection cannot be derived**:
   - DERIVED: dim(Im_H) = 3 [THEOREM from axioms]
   - DERIVED: CCF denominator = 3 [S248, from norm independence]
   - CONJECTURE: "3 CCF channels because 3 Im_H directions"
   - The mapping {A, Z, N} ↔ Im_H requires [I-PHYSICS] input from nuclear physics
   - Full derivation would need: F[ε]_nuclear = function on Im_H with {A, Z, N} as coordinates

5. **[FINDING] CNH is trivial for particle physics**:
   - All fundamental quantum numbers (Q, B, S, C, T) are 0 or ±1
   - 0 and 1 are both Gaussian norms
   - CNH provides no discrimination — everything is "crystallization-compatible"
   - CNH is specific to BBN / nuclear physics where A, Z, N are multi-digit integers

6. **[CONJECTURE] Mixing angle classification (from S248) confirmed**:
   - NON/norm: fractional observables (sin²θ_W = 28/121, Ω_m = 63/200)
   - norm/NON: suppression factors (Li-7 = 1/3, α correction = 4/111)
   - norm/norm: squared quantities (ξ = 4/121)
   This pattern is suggestive but NOT predictive — it classifies, doesn't predict.

## Open Questions

1. **Meson CCF conjecture** (from S246): Would mesons have CCF denominator = dim(C) = 2? UNTESTABLE (no frozen meson abundances, mesons decay).

2. **Heavy-ion collisions**: Could meson/baryon ratios in RHIC/LHC heavy-ion freeze-out show CCF-like patterns? POSSIBLY TESTABLE but requires explicit framework prediction.

3. **Alternative criterion #4 strategy**: Accept Li-7 as the ONE confirmed prediction and lower the bar? Or wait indefinitely for He-3/B-11/Li-6 data?

## CNH Adoption Status Summary

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| #1: Mathematical support | ✅ MET | 121/121 tests PASS |
| #2: Subsumes AXM_0118 | ✅ MET | All framework primes are Gaussian norm primes |
| #3: Explains Li-7 | ✅ MET | Factor 1/3 derived via CCF |
| #4: Independent prediction | ❌ NOT MET | He-3/B-11/Li-6 observationally blocked; no alternate paths |
| #5: CCF denominator understood | ✅ MET | Multiplicative vs additive independence (S248) |

**Blocker for adoption**: Criterion #4 requires an independent prediction confirmed. All paths are blocked:
- He-3: PDG says "inappropriate as cosmological probe"
- B-11, Li-6: No precision BBN measurements exist
- Nuclear stability: CNH fails (r = -0.15)
- Magic numbers: CNH fails (28, 126 are non-norms but magic)
- Particle physics: CNH trivial (all QNs are 0 or 1)

## Key Context for Next Session

The CNH has exhausted its near-term prediction paths. Four of five adoption criteria are met; criterion #4 (independent prediction) has no viable path currently. The Im_H = 3 connection is numerically suggestive but requires [I-PHYSICS] input that cannot be derived from axioms alone — this gap is IRREDUCIBLE. The CNH does not extend to particle physics (all quantum numbers are trivially norms).

Options for the project:
1. **Wait**: Future cosmology measurements (He-3 from stellar-free sources?) may eventually test criterion #4
2. **Lower the bar**: Accept Li-7 as sufficient for adoption (risks weakening the standard)
3. **Move on**: Keep CNH as [CONJECTURE] in AXM_0118 and pursue other priorities

The CNH suite now has 121 tests across 6 scripts — comprehensive verification of a principle that remains blocked on observational grounds.
