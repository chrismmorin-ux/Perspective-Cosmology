# Session 263: Planck's Constant — Symplectic Structure + G₂ Connection

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Planck's constant continuation: Vol(Gr) quantization + open threads
**Topic**: constants/h
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S260 (three-path expansion, CANONICAL)

---

## Outcome

Extended the CANONICAL h investigation with two major results: (1) Gr(4,11;R) has a natural symplectic structure from quaternionic H, giving 14 conjugate pairs; (2) the G₂ = Aut(O) connection to dim(Gr)/2 = 14 is STRUCTURAL, forced by Cayley-Dickson doubling [THEOREM]. Both verified computationally (34/34 PASS total).

## Key Findings

1. **No SO(4)×SO(7)-invariant symplectic form exists** [THEOREM]: Representation theory counting gives 0 trivial reps in Λ²(R^4 ⊗ R^7). The full symmetry group of Gr(4,11) does NOT provide a symplectic structure.

2. **Quaternionic H provides the symplectic form** [DERIVATION]: H = R^4 carries three complex structures J_I, J_J, J_K. Each gives ω_X on R^4. The product ω = ω_I ⊗ g_7 is a non-degenerate closed 2-form on R^28 with 14 conjugate pairs.

3. **F = C selects the unique form** [DERIVATION]: Three complex structures parametrize S² ⊂ Im_H. F = C [D: CCP] selects one, breaking Sp(1) → U(1), SO(4) → U(2). This gives the UNIQUE symplectic form.

4. **Closedness is automatic** [DERIVATION]: On symmetric space Gr(4,11) = SO(11)/(SO(4)×SO(7)), [m,m] ⊂ h guarantees dω = 0.

5. **dim(G₂) = dim(Gr)/2 is FORCED** [THEOREM]: Cayley-Dickson gives Im(O) - Im(H) = n_d. Then dim(G₂) = Im(O)·n_d/2 = n_d·Im(O)/2 = dim(Gr)/2. Same formula appears twice because both count "half the H-to-O transition degrees of freedom."

6. **G₂ acts Hamiltonianly on symplectic Grassmannian** [DERIVATION]: G₂ ⊂ SO(7) preserves ω. H¹(g₂,R) = 0 → moment map μ: Gr(4,11) → g₂* ≅ R^14 exists.

7. **Sector budget = dim(G₂) via tetrahedral formula** [DERIVATION]: 1² + 2² + 3² = Im(H)·n_d·Im(O)/6 = 14. But decomposition under G₂ gives 14 → 8+3+3̄ (via SU(3) ⊂ G₂), NOT 1+4+9. So the numerical coincidence is structural (tetrahedral number) but the representation connection remains open.

8. **Uniqueness to n_d = 4** [THEOREM]: The equality dim(Aut(next algebra)) = dim(Gr)/2 holds ONLY for H → O (n_d = 4), not for C → H (n_d = 2 gives 3 vs 4).

## Open Questions

1. **Derive |Π| from intersection theory** (EQ-038): The symplectic quantization gives |Π| = ∫(ω/2π)^14/14!, a well-defined integer. Computing it requires the intersection ring of Gr(4,11;R).

2. **Metric normalization**: For |Π| ~ 10^122, λ ~ 10^4.7 in Planck units. Does NOT match R_H/l_P ~ 10^61.

3. **Moment map geometry**: μ: Gr(4,11) → g₂* maps perspective configurations to G₂-valued data. Physical meaning?

4. **Connection to EQ-011** (V₀): Vol(Gr) factorization may connect to inflationary amplitude.

## Key Context for Next Session

The h investigation is CANONICAL with 5 paths explored (Grassmannian volume, quaternionic non-commutativity, symplectic structure, G₂ connection, holographic). The symplectic structure on Gr(4,11;R) is now established: quaternionic H provides the form, F=C selects the unique one, closedness is automatic on the symmetric space, and G₂ = Aut(O) acts Hamiltonianly with dim(G₂) = dim(Gr)/2 forced by Cayley-Dickson. The concrete next step is computing |Π| from intersection theory — this is a well-defined math problem. The metric normalization discrepancy (λ ~ 10^4.7 vs 10^61) suggests the physical metric differs from the Killing metric by a factor that may involve the cosmological horizon.
