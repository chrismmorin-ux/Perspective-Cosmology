# Session 267: Planck's Constant -- Metric Normalization and Volume Defect

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Planck's constant: metric normalization discrepancy on Gr(4,11;R)
**Topic**: constants/h
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S263 (symplectic structure + G_2 connection)

---

## Outcome

Analyzed the metric normalization discrepancy on Gr(4,11;R). The Killing metric gives Vol/(2pi)^14 = 1/D where D = 457228800 = 2^9 * 3^6 * 5^2 * 7^2 (all framework primes). Found three clean factorizations of D, including D = (n_c-1)! * C(n_c-2, n_d) = 10! * 126 [THEOREM] and D = Weyl_denom(B_5) / 90 [THEOREM]. Discovered Vol_Gr(Killing) / chi(Gr) = 0.9905 -- a 0.95% near-miss suggesting the quantization metric is close to 2pi * Killing. The discrepancy between Grassmannian and holographic state counts is PURELY RATIONAL (all pi's cancel) [THEOREM].

## Key Findings

1. **Volume defect D = 10! * C(9,4) = 457228800** [THEOREM]: The coefficient (2pi)^14/Vol_Gr factors as (n_c-1)! * C(n_c-2, n_d) = |W(SU(10))| * dim(Lambda^4(R^9)). All prime factors {2,3,5,7} are framework numbers.

2. **D = Weyl_denom(B_5) / ((n_c-2)(n_c-1))** [THEOREM]: D equals the Weyl denominator of SO(11) divided by 90 = h^v * (h^v + 1). Direct connection to root system.

3. **Vol_Gr(Killing) / chi(Gr) = 0.9905** [OBSERVATION]: The Riemannian volume in Killing metric (326.88) nearly equals the Euler characteristic (330). For complex Grassmannians, |Pi|(level 1) = chi exactly. The 0.95% deviation in the real case is unexplained.

4. **c ~ 2pi near-miss** [OBSERVATION]: If |Pi| = chi = 330, the required rescaling c satisfies c/(2pi) = 1.00068 (0.068% off). Tantalizing but not exact.

5. **Pi cancellation** [THEOREM]: The ratio Vol_Gr/(2pi)^14 is purely rational (= 1/D). The holographic pi in S_BH = pi*(R_H/l_P)^2 comes from spherical horizon geometry, external to Gr.

6. **D^(1/28) ~ 2 to 1.9%** [OBSERVATION]: The 28th root of the defect is close to C_dim = 2, but not exact.

7. **Killing metric insufficient** [THEOREM]: Vol_K/(2pi)^14 << 1, so the physical symplectic form cannot be the Killing-induced form. Rescaling required.

## Open Questions

1. **Compute alpha = omega_K / omega_int** (EQ-038): Schubert calculus on the real Grassmannian to determine the ratio of Killing-induced to integral symplectic forms. This sets the exact level-1 state count.

2. **Why Vol ~ chi to 0.95%?**: Check whether this near-coincidence holds for other real Grassmannians Gr(k,n;R), or is specific to (4,11). If universal, there's a theorem; if specific, it's a framework-number coincidence.

3. **Moment map mu: Gr(4,11) -> g_2***: Physical meaning of the G_2 moment map. Does the image select preferred configurations?

4. **Connection to EQ-011 (V_0)**: Vol(Gr) factorization and inflationary amplitude.

## Key Context for Next Session

The h investigation now has SIX paths explored (Grassmannian volume, quaternionic non-commutativity, symplectic structure, G_2 connection, holographic, metric normalization). The volume defect D = 10! * C(9,4) decomposes cleanly into framework objects. The most surprising finding is Vol(Killing) ~ chi(Gr) to 0.95% -- for complex Grassmannians this would be EXACT (level-1 geometric quantization). The next concrete step is either: (a) check the Vol ~ chi near-coincidence for other (k,n) to determine if it's structural, or (b) compute the integral symplectic form normalization via Schubert calculus (hard). The moment map and V_0 connections remain unexplored.
