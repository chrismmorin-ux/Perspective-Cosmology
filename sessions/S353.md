# Session S353: Launch C1b -- Interpretive Companion v1.0, Chunk 4

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Write Interpretive Companion v1.0 Chunk 4 (Sections 13-16: Part IV)
**Parallel**: S351 (W6 viewer), S352 (DM mass)

---

## Outcome

**C1b Chunk 4 COMPLETE.** Part IV: Numerical Consequences (Sections 13-16) written into `PC_INTERPRETIVE_COMPANION.md`. Document now at 1614 lines (up from 1219). ~395 new lines.

## Key Findings

### What Was Written

| Component | Lines | Content |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Part IV header | ~8 | Introduction: qualitative -> quantitative. HS metric foundation. IRA-11 noted |
| Section 13 | ~72 | Why Equal Weight: HS metric from C2, Schur uniqueness, cross-block democracy, foundation for all Part IV |
| Section 14 | ~80 | The Weinberg Angle: tree 28/121, dressed 28/121-alpha/(4pi^2), factorization, Killing excluded |
| Section 15 | ~110 | The Fine Structure Constant: bridge prime 137, channels 111, tree 15211/111, three bands A/B/C, honesty check |
| Section 16 | ~90 | The Higgs Sector: pNGB identification, 28=4+24 decomposition, CW potential, VEV formula, open problems |
| Derivation chain | ~20 | Part IV summary table: Weinberg, alpha, Higgs |

### Design Decisions

1. **Companion reorders math paper sections**: Math Sec 14 (alpha) and 15 (Weinberg) are swapped in companion -- Weinberg first (simpler), then alpha (more complex). Pedagogically cleaner
2. **Higgs section replaces Omega_m**: Math paper Part IV has Partition Fraction (Omega_m) as Sec 16; companion Part IV has Higgs sector instead. Omega_m moves to Part V
3. **No new [A-PHYSICAL] IRAs in Part IV**: Only IRA-06 (established Part II) reused
4. **IRA-11 enters** as the single dimensional [A-IMPORT] in the Higgs section
5. **Three-loop alpha tagged [CONJECTURE, HRS 5]**: D_3=1 clearly caveated with honest baseline at tree level (0.27 ppm)
6. **Dressed Weinberg tagged [CONJECTURE]**: 1/(4pi^2) coefficient identified not derived (Remark 15.9)
7. **Higgs mass 125.1 GeV chain tagged [CONJECTURE]**: y_t=1 identified not derived. Framework derives pNGB nature and VEV, not boson mass

### Chunk Plan Progress

| Chunk | Sections | Status | Lines |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| **1** | Frontmatter + 1-4 | **COMPLETE (S345)** | 456 |
| **2** | 5-8 | **COMPLETE (S348)** | ~395 |
| **3** | 9-12 | **COMPLETE (S350)** | ~367 |
| **4** | 13-16 | **COMPLETE (S353)** | ~395 |
| 5 | 17-20 | NOT STARTED | ~400 est |
| 6 | Appendices + review | NOT STARTED | ~350 est |

## Scripts

No new verification scripts (companion is interpretive, not computational). All referenced scripts already exist.

## Open Questions

- Chunk 5 (Sections 17-20) covers Part V: Extended Results (Yang-Mills/glueball mass, matter density Omega_m, cosmological epochs, open problems)
- Section 17 (Yang-Mills) is CANONICAL and well-documented
- Section 18 (Omega_m = 63/200) was originally math Sec 16 -- moved from companion Part IV to Part V
- Section 19-20 TBD: cosmological epochs + open problems/future directions

## Key Context for Next Session

Chunk 5 covers Part V: Extended Results. Key sources:
- Math paper Sections 16-19+ (Partition Fraction, Glueball Mass, etc.)
- `topics/yang-mills-mass-gap.md`
- `framework/investigations/cosmology/`
- S293 (Omega_m derivation), S274/S277 (glueball mass formula)
