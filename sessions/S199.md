# Session 199 — 2026-02-02

**Focus**: CMB baryon correction + CC wrong sign documentation
**Topic**: CMB physics, Gravity audit
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S198 (CMB integrals), S195 (Gravity audit)

---

## Outcome

Resolved the l_2 peak error (standard baryon loading, not a framework gap) and confirmed Om_m/Om_b algebraic structure is already well-documented. Documented the cosmological constant wrong sign problem as F-10 in FALSIFIED.md.

## Key Findings

1. **l_2 peak error RESOLVED** [DERIVED]: Separate phi_odd/phi_even baryon loading reduces l_2 error from 3.1% to 0.74%. phi_odd = 3/11 = Im_H/n_c confirmed to 0.4%. This is standard baryon physics, not a framework gap.

2. **Om_m/Om_b already documented** [CONJECTURE]: Algebraic structure (63=O²-1, 200=O(R+H)², 9/58=Im_H²/(Im_O²+Im_H²)) extensively covered in S94-126 with 4 scripts. Physical mechanism remains unknown. No new derivation paths identified.

3. **CC wrong sign confirmed as F-10** [FALSIFIED]: V(ε*) = -a²/(4b) = -α⁵M_Pl⁴ < 0 proven symbolically. Crystallization stress σ ≥ 0 is relative energy, does NOT fix absolute sign. Three incompatible CC formulas (13/19, 137/200, α⁵⁶/77). Fine-tuning ~10¹¹¹ needed. Grade F.

4. **crystallization_stress_cosmology.md → QUARANTINE**: Status downgraded from ACTIVE to QUARANTINE with [CONJECTURE] confidence. Sign problem makes core mechanism invalid.

## Scripts

| Script | Tests | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|

| `cosmological_constant_sign_analysis.py` | 10 | 10 PASS |

## Files Created
- `verification/sympy/peak_positions_baryon_corrected.py` — 7-model peak position comparison
- `verification/sympy/cosmological_constant_sign_analysis.py` — CC sign analysis

## Files Modified
- `topics/cmb-physics.md` — Added resolved questions (l_2 baryon shift, Om_m/Om_b)
- `framework/investigations/cosmology/crystallization_stress_cosmology.md` — ACTIVE → QUARANTINE
- `claims/FALSIFIED.md` — Added F-10 (CC wrong sign)

## Open Questions

1. Can Om_m = 63/200 be derived from a physical mechanism (not algebraic decomposition)?
2. Is there a V₀/M_Pl⁴ ~ 1.3 × 10⁻⁹ framework expression?
3. Can the CC sign problem be resolved without fine-tuning?
4. What sets the phi_even = 0.230 baryon loading phase?

## Key Context for Next Session

The CMB topic is in good shape: 11 derived parameters, 3 falsified claims honestly documented, 7 gaps remaining. The two biggest CMB gaps are Om_m derivation and V₀. The CC is effectively a dead end within current framework structure (F-10). The gravity audit (S195) flagged the CC as grade F — this is now formally documented.

Next actionable topics from INDEX.md:
- **Evaluation map chain** (S197): Gauge breaking chain, continuous s gap, Herm(2)=spacetime
- **Recursive gap tower** (S196): Derive rank-4 at meta-levels, falsifiability, arithmetic encoding
- **Phase 7 statistics**: Cross-framework statistical assessment (deferred from multiple phases)
