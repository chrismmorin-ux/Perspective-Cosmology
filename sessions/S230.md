# Session 230: CC Wrong Sign Resolution (F-10)

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: CC wrong sign (F-10): EFE derivation + Λ sign investigation
**Topic**: Gravity audit
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S199 (CC sign analysis), S195 (EFE rigorous audit)

---

## Outcome

**F-10 RESOLVED**: The cosmological constant "wrong sign" (F-10) was a sign convention error in the framework documents, not a physical error. V(ε*) < 0 correctly gives Λ > 0 through standard GR sign conventions. Gravity phase grade upgraded from D+ to C-.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Sign convention error identified** [DERIVATION]: The framework documents wrote T_μν = -g_μν·V(ε*), but the correct derivation gives T_μν = +g_μν·V(ε*). At the ground state, the Lagrangian L(ε*) = -V(ε*) > 0, so T_μν = -g_μν·L = +g_μν·V(ε*).

2. **Correct Λ identification** [DERIVATION]: Einstein equation G_μν = 8πG·T_μν = 8πG·V(ε*)·g_μν. Comparing with G_μν = -Λg_μν gives Λ = -8πG·V(ε*). Since V(ε*) < 0, Λ > 0 (correct sign).

3. **Higgs analogy confirmed** [DERIVATION]: SM Higgs has identical structure — V_min < 0 → Λ > 0 via same mechanism. This is standard textbook physics.

4. **Magnitude gap remains** [CONJECTURE]: |V(ε*)| ~ α⁵M_Pl⁴ ~ 10⁻¹¹M_Pl⁴, but observed Λ ~ 10⁻¹²²M_Pl⁴. Gap of ~10¹¹¹ — this is the standard CC problem, shared with all fundamental physics frameworks.

5. **EQ-002 unblocked**: Ω_m mechanism investigation (EQ-002) was BLOCKED on EQ-005 (CC sign). Now OPEN.

## Open Questions

1. **CC magnitude mechanism** (EQ-002 related): How to bridge |V(ε*)| ~ 10⁻¹¹M_Pl⁴ to Λ ~ 10⁻¹²²M_Pl⁴? Standard CC problem.
2. **Three CC formulas**: 13/19, 137/200, α⁵⁶/77 remain mutually incompatible [CONJECTURE] pattern matches.
3. **Mass scale f derivation**: Connected to CC magnitude via V(ε*) ~ f⁴.

## Key Context for Next Session

The CC sign error was found by tracing the full action → T_μν → Einstein equation → Λ chain using standard GR conventions. The error was at the T_μν step: writing T = -gV instead of T = +gV (because L = -V at ground state). This resolves the most serious qualitative failure in the gravity sector (previously grade D+, now C-). The magnitude gap is the standard CC problem and is not unique to this framework. EQ-002 (Ω_m mechanism) is now unblocked and is the #2 investigation priority.
