## Outcome

Wrote ~470 lines covering Part III: Algebraic Structure (Sections 9-12). Document updated from v0.5 to v0.7 (~1200 total lines). Parts I-III now complete. Zero TODOs.

## Key Findings

1. **End(V) four-block decomposition** (Sec 9): V = W + W_perp gives End(V) = 16 + 28 + 28 + 49 = 121. Nine-block CCP refinement from V = Im(C) + Im(H) + Im(O). Structure automorphism group Aut_alg(V) = {1} x SO(3) x G_2, dim = 17. Full irrep decomposition under SO(3) and G_2.

2. **Selection pipeline** (Sec 10): Four-step reduction 121 -> 55 -> 27 -> 18 -> 12. Step 1 (norm preservation): so(11). Step 2 (stabilizer restriction): so(4) + so(7). Step 3 (CCP-algebraic closure): g_2 replaces so(7), plus su(2) x u(1) from F=C within so(4). Step 4 (crystallization stability): su(3) as G_2 stabilizer on S^6.

3. **Gauge algebra** (Sec 11): u(1) + su(2) + su(3), dim = 12. Key insight from S328: U(1) factor comes from F=C selecting complex structure J = L_i in SO(4), breaking SU(2)_+ -> U(1). The su(2) factor is the anti-self-dual SU(2)_- that commutes with J. The su(3) is the G_2 stabilizer of the crystallization direction on S^6.

4. **Generation structure** (Sec 12): Hom(H, R^7) = R^7 + 3*R^7 from H = R + Im(H), giving 3 independent generation channels [DERIVATION]. G_2 -> SU(3) branching: 7 -> 3 + 3bar + 1 (matter content). PSL(2,7) as independent confirmation (irreps {1,3,3',6,7,8}). Structural identity: 3 x 7 = 21 = dim(so(7)).

### Writing Decisions

- Restructured pipeline from source document's 55->18 single step into two sub-steps (55->27->18) for mathematical clarity
- U(1) origin follows S328 correction: complex structure J in SO(4), not "from Im_C" as pipeline doc originally suggested
- PSL(2,7) presented as Remark (independent confirmation) not part of the main derivation chain

## Open Questions

1. **Chunk 4** (Part IV: Secs 13-16): Democratic counting + Schur, alpha chain (137+4/111), Weinberg angle (28/121), Omega_m = 63/200. Key sources: `ALPHA_DERIVATION_MASTER.md`, `constants_from_dimensions.md`, S266, S276, S293.

## Key Context for Next Session

Part III ends with the generation structure (3 families of 7 fermion types each). Part IV picks up with the *numerical* consequences: how democratic counting on the 121 End(V) generators, combined with Schur's lemma normalization, produces exact rational predictions for coupling constants and cosmological parameters. The transition is from algebraic structure to quantitative prediction. The alpha derivation chain (137 + 4/111, zero conjectures) is the centerpiece of Part IV.
