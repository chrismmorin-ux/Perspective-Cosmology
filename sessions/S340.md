# Session S340: Launch C1a — Math Foundations Chunk 4 (Part IV)

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Write Part IV (Numerical Consequences, Sections 13-16) of PC_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md
**Topic**: `launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` Section 3.1a (Chunk 4 of 6)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S338 (Chunk 3: Part III)
**Next**: Chunk 5 (Part V: Sections 17-20)

---

## Outcome

Part IV complete. Document upgraded from v0.7 to v0.9 (~1700 lines total, ~500 new). Four sections written covering democratic counting, the interface invariant (alpha), the mixing ratio (Weinberg angle), and the partition fraction (Omega_m). All three numerical invariants derived from the same principle (HS democracy on End(V)) with zero free parameters.

## Key Findings

1. **Section 13: Democratic Counting and Schur's Lemma** [THEOREM/DERIVATION]
   - HS metric on End(V) inherited from crystal axiom C2 orthonormality
   - Schur's lemma: unique SO(n_c)-invariant inner product on End(V)
   - Cross-block democracy: all 121 generators have equal HS norm 1/n_c
   - Democratic counting principle established as foundation for Part IV

2. **Section 14: The Interface Invariant** [DERIVATION]
   - I_0 = n_d^2 + n_c^2 = 137 from Radon-Hurwitz algebraic independence (CONJ-A3)
   - Cyclotomic channels: Phi_6(n_c) = 111 transition channels
   - Equal distribution theorem (4 independent proofs: direct, spectral, averaging, dimensional)
   - Enhanced: I = 137 + 4/111 = 15211/111 (0.27 ppm from 1/alpha)
   - Double-trace refinement: C = 24/11 from EM index density rho = Tr(Q^2)/n_c = 2/11
   - Dressed invariant: I_dressed = 137.035999053 (0.0009 ppm from CODATA 2022)

3. **Section 15: The Mixing Ratio** [DERIVATION]
   - R = n_d(n_c - n_d)/n_c^2 = 28/121 from cross-sector coupling fraction
   - 28 = dim(Hom(R^4, R^7)) = n_d * Im(O)
   - Charge trace analysis: sum(Q^2) over coset
   - One-loop correction: R_dressed = 28/121 - 1/(I * 4*pi^2) [CONJECTURE]

4. **Section 16: The Partition Fraction** [DERIVATION]
   - Structure algebra su(4) + su(7) has N_str = 63 generators
   - 63 generators serve dual role (structure + interface), 74 are interface-only
   - HS equipartition: F = N_str / (I_0 + N_str) = 63/200
   - Dual-channel identity: 137 + 63 = 200

## Open Questions

1. **Chunk 5 scope** (EQ: none): Part V covers Yang-Mills mass gap (CANONICAL), QM from axioms, Einstein equations, and tree-to-dressed paradigm. Key sources: `yang_mills_mass_gap.md`, S302 (QM), `einstein_from_crystallization.md`, S266/S308 (bands).

2. **Appendices** (Chunk 6): Full proofs of CONJ-A3 (Radon-Hurwitz), CONJ-B1 (FFT), CONJ-A1 (spectral convergence), plus verification script index.

## Key Context for Next Session

Part IV is the numerical heart of the document — the three exact rational invariants (137+4/111, 28/121, 63/200) all from HS democracy on End(V). Part V should build on this by presenting extended results: Yang-Mills mass gap (the CANONICAL investigation with glueball spectrum), QM derivation (3 routes including THM_0491), Einstein equations from crystallization dynamics, and the tree-to-dressed correction band paradigm that organizes all predictions into a systematic hierarchy. Key decision: how much detail for Yang-Mills (it's the most technically dense topic) vs keeping Part V at ~400 lines per the chunk plan.
