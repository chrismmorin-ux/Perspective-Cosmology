# Session 268: Yang-Mills Mass Gap — Framework Approach

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Yang-Mills mass gap problem and framework structural contributions
**Topic**: Gauge theory / crystallization
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S267 (Planck's constant)
**Next**: Open — could pursue Landau coefficient derivation (EQ-041) or other gauge topics

## Outcome

Explored the Yang-Mills mass gap (Millennium Prize) through the Perspective framework lens. Produced a comprehensive investigation file with 7 structural contributions, formalized O-channel crystallization via Landau-Ginzburg theory with Z_3-invariant potential, and identified the "no Goldstone for discrete symmetry" argument as the key structural insight for why a mass gap must exist. Two verification scripts (33/33 total PASS).

## Key Findings

1. **Pure gauge b_0 = n_c = 11** [DERIVATION]: The Millennium Prize case (no matter) has beta coefficient exactly equal to the crystal dimension. Paramagnetic decomposition: 11 = n_d + Im_O = 4 + 7. Paramagnetic dominance Im_O/n_d = 7/4 > 1 drives asymptotic freedom.

2. **d = 4 criticality** [DERIVATION]: n_d = 4 from Frobenius is exactly the dimension where gauge coupling becomes dimensionless (marginal), making the mass gap a hard problem. Lower d: super-renormalizable (solvable). Higher d: non-renormalizable (trivial).

3. **Z_3 center symmetry from Im_H = 3** [DERIVATION]: Center of SU(N_c) = Z_{N_c} = Z_{Im_H} = Z_3. Polyakov loop order parameter transforms under Z_3. The cubic L^3 term in the Landau potential exists because Im_H = 3, and Im_H < dim_H (3 < 4) makes cubic sub-quartic, forcing a first-order deconfinement transition. Confirmed by lattice QCD.

4. **No Goldstone for discrete Z_3** [DERIVATION]: In confined phase, Z_3 is unbroken. Discrete symmetries cannot produce massless Goldstone bosons. Therefore mass gap Delta > 0 is structurally guaranteed. This is the O-channel analog of Higgs (H-channel) but with discrete rather than continuous symmetry.

5. **Glueball mass conjecture: m_0++ = n_d * sqrt(sigma)** [CONJECTURE, HRS=5]: Prediction 1766 MeV vs lattice 1730 +/- 80 MeV (2.1%, within uncertainty). Ratio search, not derivation. Queued to formalization queue.

6. **Division algebra force classification** [DERIVATION]: C -> U(1) (no confinement), H -> SU(2) (would confine if unbroken), O -> SU(3) (confines). Non-associativity of O forces non-Abelian gauge group, which forces asymptotic freedom.

7. **O-channel crystallization = confinement** [CONJECTURE]: The non-perturbative gap "AF -> ??? -> confinement" may be filled by O-channel crystallization as a phase transition at Lambda_QCD, analogous to how H-channel crystallization (Higgs) gives W/Z masses.

## Open Questions

1. **Landau coefficients from framework** (EQ-041): Can a_2, a_3, a_4 in the Z_3-invariant potential be derived from framework quantities (n_d, n_c, Im_H, Im_O)?
2. **Glueball structural argument**: Why should m_0++ / sqrt(sigma) = n_d = 4? Is there a polarization/momentum mode counting argument?
3. **Rigorous crystallization**: Can O-channel crystallization be made mathematically rigorous (Wightman axioms)?

## Key Context for Next Session

Session established the Yang-Mills mass gap investigation with two phases. Phase 1 identified 6 structural contributions (beta coefficients, d=4 criticality, force classification). Phase 2 formalized O-channel crystallization using Landau-Ginzburg theory: Z_3 center symmetry from Im_H=3, cubic L^3 drives first-order transition, no Goldstone for discrete symmetry guarantees mass gap. The framework does NOT solve the Millennium Prize (no rigorous QFT existence proof) but provides structural insights for why the mass gap exists. The glueball mass conjecture m_0++ = n_d * sqrt(sigma) is queued as [CONJECTURE] HRS=5.
