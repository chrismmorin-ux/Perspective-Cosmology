# Session S299: A-PHYSICAL IRAs — Independence and Reducibility Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: IRA-06/07/08/09 independence, redundancy, and minimal irreducible core
**Topic**: Irreducible assumptions (`framework/IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md`)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S298 (IRA-04), S297 (CONJ-A2), S259 (IRA landscape)
**Next**: See open questions

---

## Outcome

**IRA-08 and IRA-09 RESOLVED**. Both are DERIVED from IRA-06 — neither adds irreducible content. IRA-06 and IRA-07 survive as genuinely independent but are "Weinberg-forced" (structural isomorphism leaves no alternative interpretation). IRA count **8 -> 6**. The [A-PHYSICAL] sector reduces from 4 assumptions to 2.

## Key Findings

1. **IRA-08 subsumed by IRA-06** [DERIVED]: Epsilon is the ONLY continuous degree of freedom on Gr(4,11). Given crystallization = SSB (IRA-06), the order parameter IS the physical field by definition. There is no separate identification step. "Why epsilon and not something else?" has a definitive answer: there IS nothing else. The FFT proves exactly 2 quartic invariants, both functions of epsilon. No other candidate exists.

2. **IRA-09 subsumed by IRA-06 + Weinberg criterion** [DERIVED]: The G_2 -> SU(3) branching 7 -> 3+3bar+1 [I-MATH] produces 3 copies with identical gauge quantum numbers — the defining property of "generations." No plausible alternative identified: not color (different SU(3)), not spatial dims (already Im_H). The Weinberg criterion (all properties present + no alternative = forced identification) applies.

3. **IRA-06 and IRA-07 genuinely independent** [A-PHYSICAL]: They address different domains. IRA-06: WHAT happens (gradient flow = SSB). IRA-07: WHEN it happens (directed sequences = time). Neither logically requires the other.

4. **Weinberg criterion characterization** [OBSERVATION]: Both surviving IRAs are Weinberg-forced — the mathematical structure has ALL defining properties of the physical phenomenon and no properties inconsistent with it. For IRA-06: all 8 SSB properties present. For IRA-07: all 6 time properties present. This is the bedrock meta-assumption of mathematical physics itself (Newton, Maxwell, Einstein all made it implicitly), not specific to this framework.

5. **Conservative vs moderate reduction**: Conservative: 4 -> 2 (IRA-06, IRA-07 remain as [A-PHYSICAL]). Moderate: 4 -> 1 meta-assumption (Weinberg criterion subsumes all 4, total IRA = 5). Analysis adopts conservative view.

6. **Adversarial checks survived**: (a) "ε is composite, not elementary Higgs" — feature not bug, composite Higgs model structure is derived. (b) "3 copies need not be generations" — no alternative interpretation articulated. (c) "IRA-06/07 are the same kind of assumption" — true (both Layer 2 identifications) but they're in different domains (process vs parameter), so genuinely independent.

## Derivation Chain

```
IRA-06 (crystallization = SSB) [A-PHYSICAL, Weinberg-forced]
  + eps is ONLY continuous DOF on Gr(4,11) [DERIVED]
  + In SSB, order parameter IS the physical field [DEFINITION]
  -> IRA-08 RESOLVED [no additional content]

IRA-06 (crystallization = SSB) [A-PHYSICAL, Weinberg-forced]
  + Fermions = spinorial reps of SO(11) [DERIVED from CCP]
  + SO(7) contains G_2 contains SU(3) [I-MATH]
  + 7 -> 3 + 3bar + 1 under G_2 -> SU(3) [I-MATH]
  + 3 copies have all generation-defining properties [VERIFICATION]
  + No plausible alternative interpretation [VERIFICATION]
  + Weinberg criterion [META-PRINCIPLE]
  -> IRA-09 RESOLVED [no alternative identification]
```

## IRA Inventory After S299

| ID | Type | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| IRA-01 | [A-STRUCTURAL] | Active | kappa=1 (S297) |
| IRA-04 | [A-STRUCTURAL] | Active (LOW) | Ratio rho (S298) |
| IRA-06 | [A-PHYSICAL] | Active, Weinberg-forced | Crystallization = SSB |
| IRA-07 | [A-PHYSICAL] | Active, Weinberg-forced | Adjacency = time |
| IRA-10 | [A-INTERPRETATION] | Active | Perspectives = QM |
| IRA-11 | [A-IMPORT] | Active | |Pi| ~ 10^118 |
| **Total** | | **6** | Down from 8 (IRA-08, IRA-09 resolved) |

Type distribution: 0 conjectures, 2 structural, 2 physical, 1 interpretation, 1 import.

## Open Questions

1. **Can IRA-06/07 be further reduced?** The moderate view (Weinberg criterion subsumes both) would give total IRA = 5. But the Weinberg criterion is universal to mathematical physics, so whether to count it is a philosophical question, not a technical one.
2. **IRA-10 redundancy with IRA-07?** THM_0491 derives Hilbert space from perspective axioms. THM_0494 derives Born rule. Is "perspectives = QM" already implied by IRA-07 + these theorems? Worth investigating.
3. **IRA-11 bounds**: Can the perspective count |Pi| be bounded (not derived exactly) from internal consistency? Would reduce from [A-IMPORT] to [A-STRUCTURAL] or [DERIVATION].

## Key Context for Next Session

IRA count now 6 (was 8). The [A-PHYSICAL] sector has been halved: 4 -> 2 independent assumptions, both Weinberg-forced. The remaining 6 IRAs are well-characterized: 2 structural (alpha convention, quartic ratio), 2 physical (SSB, time), 1 interpretation (QM), 1 import (cosmological scale). The framework's assumption landscape is now sharp and compact. Next high-value targets: IRA-10 redundancy investigation (Open Q2), or move to new physics (LLM Challenge v3, Yang-Mills extensions, etc.).
