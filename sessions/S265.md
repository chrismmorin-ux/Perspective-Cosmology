# Session S265: Pi from Foundations

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Derive pi from framework axioms
**Topic**: Constants / Pi
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S264 (Quality Engine fixes)
**Next**: S270 (Pi-power formalization continuation)

---

## Outcome

Established that pi is FORCED by CCP (not imported) through a clean derivation chain. Discovered that pi-power sums over D_fw subsets reproduce all framework dimensions. Found the triple identity n_d^2 = 2^n_d = 16 and its connection to alpha (137 = pi-sum + n_c^2). Proved that CCP truncation at Hurwitz boundary is necessary for these self-referential properties.

**92/92 PASS** across 3 verification scripts.

## Key Findings

1. **Pi forced by CCP** [THEOREM]: CCP-4 forces F=C -> exp: iR -> U(1) has half-period pi -> pi enters as structural constant of the forced scalar field.

2. **Gaussian integral = CNH norm** [THEOREM]: pi = integral of e^{-N(z)} over C, where N(z) = x^2 + y^2 is the same Gaussian norm that CNH uses to classify D_fw.

3. **Pi-power map** [DERIVATION]: f(d) = floor(d/2) = rank(SO(d)) counts the effective power of pi in Vol(S^{d-1}). This map encodes the Cayley-Dickson descent: floor(Im(D_k)/2) = Im(D_{k-1}).

4. **Pi-power sum theorems** [CONJECTURE -> promote to THEOREM]:
   - DA dims {1,2,4,8}: sum = 7 = Im(O)
   - Imaginary dims {1,3,7}: sum = 4 = n_d
   - D_fw minus {11}: sum = 11 = n_c
   - All D_fw {1,2,3,4,7,8,11}: sum = 16 = n_d^2 = 2^n_d

5. **Triple identity** [THEOREM]: n_d^2 = 2^n_d has only solutions n in {2, 4} = {dim C, dim H}. For n_d = 4, the total pi-power sum equals 16 = n_d^2 = 2^n_d.

6. **Alpha connection** [CONJECTURE]: 137 = (total pi-power sum over D_fw) + n_c^2 = 16 + 121.

7. **Truncation necessity** [THEOREM]: Extending to sedenions (dim 16) breaks: Im sum != n_d, n_c = 3n_d - 1 fails, n_d^2 != 2^n_d, and 137 primality lost.

8. **Parity decomposition**: D_fw has exactly n_d = 4 odd elements {1,3,7,11} and Im(H) = 3 even elements {2,4,8}. Total |D_fw| = 7 = Im(O).

9. **Fundamental identity**: n_c = 3n_d - 1 = 2n_d + Im(H).

10. **Coefficient primes**: All Vol(S^{d-1}) coefficients for d in D_fw have prime factors in {2, 3, 5, 7} = primes up to Im(O).

## Open Questions

1. **Pi-power self-referential structure** (EQ-040): Why does the pi-power map f(d) = floor(d/2) produce framework dimensions when summed over D_fw subsets? Is there a deeper category-theoretic or representation-theoretic explanation?

2. **Promote to core theorem**: The pi-power sum theorems should become THM_04B5 (or similar). Currently [CONJECTURE] pending formalization.

3. **Alpha update**: The decomposition 137 = 16 + 121 = pi-sum + n_c^2 should be cross-referenced with existing alpha investigations.

4. **CCP truncation note**: The truncation necessity argument strengthens AXM_0120 -- sedenion extension destroys all self-referential properties simultaneously.

## Key Context for Next Session

Pi is not derived numerically (impossible -- transcendental). Instead, its EXISTENCE is forced by CCP (F=C -> U(1) -> pi), and its STRUCTURAL ROLE is encoded by pi-power sums that reproduce framework dimensions. The pi-power map floor(d/2) acts as a Cayley-Dickson descent operator, connecting each algebra's imaginary dimension to the previous algebra. The total pi-power sum over D_fw equals 16 = n_d^2 = 2^n_d, a triple coincidence unique to n_d = 4. Combined with n_c^2 = 121, this gives 137 = alpha's integer part. Three formalization items were queued (FORMALIZATION_QUEUE.md) and EQ-040 was opened.
