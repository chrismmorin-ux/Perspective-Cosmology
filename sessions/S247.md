# Session 247: Gap Analysis Session C — Gravitational Scattering Batch

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Crystallization Catalog: Gravitational scattering batch (Gap Analysis Session C)
**Topic**: Crystallization Catalog / Gravity audit
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S245 (Gap Analysis Session B), S230 (CC sign resolution)

---

## Outcome

**5 entries upgraded R→C** (#29-32 gravitational scattering, #79 binary inspiral). Einstein equations derivation (grade C-) assessed as sufficient for FRAMEWORK-CONSTRAINED via the chain n_d=4 → metric → Lovelock → EFE. Gravitational scattering sub-catalog: 0%→100%. Gravitational waves: 50%→75%. Gap Analysis Sessions A+B+C now complete: 18 total upgrades, framework density crossed 50%.

## Key Findings

1. **EFE derivation quality sufficient for CONSTRAINED** [ASSESSMENT]: The chain n_d=4 [D: Frobenius, CANONICAL] → n_d²=16 metric DOF [D] → Lorentz signature (1,3) [D: THM_04AE] → general covariance [D] → Lovelock uniqueness [I-MATH] → EFE [D via I-MATH] is a genuine [DERIVATION], with Lovelock as the key import. This is the same pattern as N_c=3 → QCD predictions: a framework-derived quantity feeds through a derived equation to produce standard consequences. Grade C- is not perfect but represents real derivation chain, not mere relabeling.

2. **All 5 classical GR predictions verified numerically** [VERIFICATION]:
   - #29 Lensing: θ = 4GM/(c²b) = 1.7512" at solar limb (confirmed to 0.01")
   - #30 Precession: Δφ = 42.98"/cy for Mercury (confirmed to 0.002%)
   - #31 Shapiro: γ_PPN = 1 (Cassini: 1 ± 2.3×10⁻⁵, 23 ppm precision)
   - #32 Frame dragging: GP-B geodetic 6602±18 mas/yr (GR: 6606), LT 37.2±7.2 (GR: 39.2)
   - #79 Inspiral: Hulse-Taylor Pdot_obs/Pdot_GR = 0.9983±0.0016 (0.17%)

3. **Honest gaps documented** [GAPS]:
   - Lovelock theorem is [I-MATH] import (powerful but external)
   - Newton's G imported (M_Pl not derived)
   - 2-derivative truncation not justified
   - CC magnitude ~10^111 discrepancy remains
   - No predictions BEYOND GR

4. **Gap Analysis three-session plan COMPLETE** [MILESTONE]:
   - Session A (S243): 9 NEAR-MISS R→C
   - Session B (S245): 4 DERIVATION GAP R→C
   - Session C (S247): 5 DERIVATION GAP R→C
   - Total: 18 upgrades, 3D/54C/42R (54.5% non-RELABELED)

## Open Questions

1. **Remaining 8 DERIVATION GAP entries**: #9 (t→bW, EQ-006), #25 (nu CC), #36 (Delta baryons), #45 (glueballs), #68 (leptogenesis, EQ-025), #75 (NS TOV), #84 (UHE cosmic rays), #98 (secondary CMB/ISW). All require significant physics work.
2. **Remaining 4 NEAR-MISS**: #2 (muon decay), #3 (charged pion), #18 (Moller), #50 (Lamb shift). Each has specific complications.
3. **C→D opportunities**: #56 (Higgs mechanism), #10 (pi0→γγ), #47/#49 (hydrogen/positronium via EQ-003). Higher leverage but harder.

## Key Context for Next Session

The Gap Analysis three-session plan (A+B+C) is now complete. The catalog has crossed 50% framework density (54.5% non-RELABELED). The remaining 42 STANDARD-RELABELED entries decompose as: 25 STRUCTURAL (permanently not upgradeable), 5 INPUT GAP (CKM-blocked), 4 complicated NEAR-MISS, and 8 DERIVATION GAP (all medium-hard open problems). Further catalog upgrades require either resolving EQ items (EQ-003 for alpha, EQ-006 for top Yukawa, EQ-025 for nu_R) or making physics breakthroughs. The next high-leverage actions are likely physics investigations rather than more catalog work.
