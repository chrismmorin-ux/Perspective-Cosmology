# Session 222: Two-Regime Structural Theorem — T_fund = 1 and Singlet Criterion

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Weinberg angle two-regime mechanism (EQ-007)
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S218 (SU(3) mode counting test)

## Outcome

Two open questions from S218 resolved. (1) **T_fund = 1 is NOT a coincidence** — it's forced by division algebra minimality [DERIVATION]. Both H and Im_O host exactly one conjugate pair of the gauge fundamental with zero excess dimensions; Frobenius theorem guarantees no intermediate sizes. (2) **Singlet criterion** [CONJECTURE] explains WHICH regime applies: 0 singlets in R⁴ → interface (N=28), 1 singlet in R⁷ → internal (N=8). The asymmetry traces to H being associative (canonical SU(2)² factorization, no direction chosen) vs O being non-associative (G₂→SU(3) requires choosing i, creating invariant direction). Gap refined from "why two regimes?" to "why democratic counting?" (why 1/g² = dim of manifold).

## Key Findings

### 1. T_fund = 1 from Division Algebra Minimality [DERIVATION]

Both gauge groups give T(fund) = 1 because each hosts exactly ONE conjugate pair of the gauge fundamental representation:

| Gauge | Space | Decomposition | Pairs | Singlets | Excess | T |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------|----------|--------|---|
| SU(2)_L | R⁴ = H | (2,2) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| SU(3) | R⁷ = Im_O | 1+3+3* | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

**Minimality**: dim(H) = 4 = 2×dim_ℂ(fund SU(2)) and dim(Im_O) = 7 = 1 + 2×dim_ℂ(fund SU(3)). Both are the smallest possible dimensions (Frobenius: only R,C,H,O exist). Non-division-algebra dims give T≠1 (verified: m=3→T=2, m=5→T=3/2, m=6→T=3/2, m=8→T=2 for SU(2); dim=14→T=2 for SU(3)).

### 2. Singlet Criterion for Two Regimes [CONJECTURE]

| Criterion | Regime | N | Description |
|-----------|--------|---|-------------|
| 0 singlets in fund space | Interface | dim(coset) | Gauge group sees ALL Goldstone modes |
| ≥1 singlet in fund space | Internal | dim(group) | Goldstone modes not natural phase space |

- **SU(2)_L**: R⁴ = (2,2) has 0 SU(2)_L singlets → every Goldstone mode (in Hom(R⁴,R⁷)) carries SU(2) charge → N_SU2 = 28 (all Goldstone modes)
- **SU(3)**: R⁷ = 1+3+3* has 1 singlet → only 24/28 Goldstone modes are SU(3)-charged → Goldstone counting fails (28/24 = 1.17, not 3.49) → N_SU3 = dim(SU(3)) = 8

### 3. Root Cause: Associativity vs Non-Associativity [CONJECTURE]

The singlet asymmetry traces to the deepest algebraic property:
- **H is associative** → left/right multiplication commute → SO(4) = SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R is a CANONICAL factorization → no direction chosen → no invariant direction → 0 singlets
- **O is non-associative** → no canonical left-right decomposition → G₂ = Aut(O) is smaller than SO(7) → G₂ → SU(3) requires CHOOSING a complex structure (fixing i ∈ Im_O) → chosen direction is invariant → 1 singlet

The coupling ratio α₃/α₂ = 7/2 ultimately arises because quaternions are associative and octonions are not.

### 4. Refined Gap Statement

**Resolved**: WHICH regime applies (singlet criterion)
**Unresolved**: WHY 1/g² = dim(manifold) (democratic counting mechanism)

Five candidate mechanisms:
1. First-order transition erases Dynkin weights (most promising, connects to S211)
2. Lattice discreteness → nearest-neighbor counting
3. Information-theoretic → dimension = channel capacity
4. Emergent gauge field → geometric norm not group-theoretic
5. Born rule on configuration space → uniform measure on Goldstone/group manifold (new, S222)

## Open Questions

1. **Democratic counting mechanism** (EQ-007 REFINED): Why does 1/g² = dim(manifold)? The singlet criterion tells which regime but not why each regime gives that counting. First-order transition argument (S211) is most promising — sharp phase transition may erase Dynkin weighting. Born rule on configuration space (uniform measure on symmetric space / Lie group) is a new candidate.
2. **Connection to EQ-003** (Step 5): The gauge kinetic term normalization in the alpha derivation shares the same "why democratic?" gap. Resolution of EQ-007 would likely resolve EQ-003.
3. **U(1)_Y regime**: Hypercharge coupling 1/g'² = 93 = 121 - 28. Does the singlet criterion apply to U(1)_Y? What's the fundamental space and singlet count?

## Key Context for Next Session

S222 resolved two of three S218 open questions. T_fund=1 is structural [DERIVATION] from division algebra minimality. Singlet criterion [CONJECTURE] determines which regime (0 singlets → interface/coset, 1 singlet → internal/group), rooted in associativity (H) vs non-associativity (O). The remaining gap is now purely "why democratic counting?" — why does each mode on the relevant manifold contribute weight 1 to 1/g²? Five candidate mechanisms identified, first-order transition and Born-rule-on-config-space most promising. 18/18 PASS.
