# Session S322: Scalar Channel DM Identity + Generation Open Questions

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Focus**: Resolve 3 open questions from S321 (scalar channel, 21=so(7), mass hierarchy)
**Topic**: Generation structure / dark matter
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S321 (generation mechanism formalization)

---

## Outcome

Resolved 2 of 3 open questions from S321. The scalar channel (R^7 from Hom(R, R^7)) is identified as the dark matter sector [CONJECTURE], providing the missing DM particle identity reopened in S320. The 3*7 = 21 = dim(so(7)) coincidence is proven STRUCTURAL [THEOREM] via the Cayley-Dickson doubling identity. Mass hierarchy from SO(3)_family breaking is a NEGATIVE RESULT -- quaternion structure gives ordering but not magnitude. New concept: H-parity (quaternion conjugation grading) stabilizes dark matter.

## Key Findings

1. **DM = scalar channel color singlet** [CONJECTURE]: The Hom(R, R^7) = R^7 scalar channel provides the dark matter particle identity. The color-singlet component (1 in 7->3+3bar+1 under G_2->SU(3)) is: generation singlet (SO(3) fixed), Higgs-decoupled (R perp Im(H)), single species (dim(R)=1), electrically neutral (SM singlet), stable (H-parity). Unifies S317 (g=0), S315 (mass formula), and S321 (generation mechanism).

2. **H-parity = quaternion conjugation** [DERIVATION]: The Z_2 grading q -> q* on H gives R(+1) vs Im(H)(-1). Dark matter is the lightest H-parity(+1) state. SM fermions are H-parity(-1). DM -> SM decay is FORBIDDEN by H-parity conservation. Analogous to R-parity in SUSY but DERIVED from H = R + Im(H).

3. **1+3 = n_d unification** [DERIVATION]: n_d = 4 = 1 dark sector + 3 SM generations. The number 4 = dim(H) simultaneously explains 4D spacetime, 3 generations, and 1 DM species.

4. **21 = dim(so(7)) is STRUCTURAL** [THEOREM]: Im(H)*Im(O) = dim(so(Im(O))) follows from Cayley-Dickson doubling: Im(D_{k+1}) = 2*Im(D_k)+1 => Im(D_k)*Im(D_{k+1}) = n*(2n+1) = dim(so(2n+1)). Universal chain: R->C: 0*1=0, C->H: 1*3=3=dim(so(3)), H->O: 3*7=21=dim(so(7)). The 28=7+21 Hom decomposition matches SO(8)->SO(7) adjoint branching.

5. **Mass hierarchy: NEGATIVE RESULT**: SO(3)_family breaking gives 2+1 ordering (F=C selects 1 of 3) but not hierarchical magnitudes. Z_3 cyclic gives equal magnitudes. epsilon=1/n_c wrong by 7-12x. The flavor puzzle remains OPEN. Framework provides 3 gens + y_t=1 + 2+1 ordering but not inter-generation ratios.

6. **EQ-043 PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: DM particle identity now provided (scalar channel color singlet). n_DM = n_baryon has a structural mechanism (shared composite dynamics) but no quantitative derivation.

## Open Questions

1. **Dark quarks** (NEW): What happens to the colored components (3+3bar) of the scalar channel? Heavy confinement? Observable at colliders?
2. **Koide formula** (EQ-NEW): Can the 2/3 ratio be derived from S^2 = SO(3)/U(1) geometry? [SPECULATION]
3. **CKM/PMNS**: Can mixing matrices be derived from SO(3)_family breaking?
4. **H-parity conservation**: Is H-parity exact or approximate? What breaks it?
5. **n_DM = n_baryon quantitative** (EQ-043 remaining): Derive the equality from SO(11) strong dynamics

## Key Context for Next Session

S322 identified the scalar channel (Hom(R, R^7)) as the dark matter sector, providing the particle identity missing since S320. The key new concept is H-parity: the Z_2 grading from quaternion conjugation that stabilizes DM. This unifies the generation mechanism (S321), DM coupling suppression (S317), and mass formula (S315) into a single picture: n_d = 4 = 1 dark + 3 visible. The 21=dim(so(7)) identity is proven structural via Cayley-Dickson. Mass hierarchy is confirmed OPEN -- the framework provides counting and top mass but not inter-generation ratios. 100/100 PASS across 3 new scripts.
