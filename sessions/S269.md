# Session S269: Alpha -- Structural Derivation of C = 24/11

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Derive C = 24/11 from composite sector structure (EQ-039)
**Topic**: Alpha / constants
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S266 (tree->dressed paradigm + C = 24/11 discovery), S262 (radiative gap)

## Outcome

**Partial resolution of EQ-039**: The numerator 24 is now DERIVED from the SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) coset structure. The denominator n_c = 11 is DERIVED from CCP. The combination C = 24/n_c remains [CONJECTURE] because the 1/n_c channel fraction is heuristically motivated but not rigorously proven. Three equivalent structural interpretations support 1/n_c. New finding: the residual after C = 24/11 is 0.8x the three-loop scale alpha^3/pi^2.

## Key Findings

1. **[DERIVED] N_colored = 24 from coset structure**: SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) has dim = 28 pNGBs. Under SU(3): 7 -> 1+3+3bar. So (4,7) = (4,1) + (4,3) + (4,3bar) = 4 Higgs + 24 colored. The 24 is forced by group theory (THM_0487 + branching rules).

2. **[DERIVED] EM charges of colored pNGBs**: The (2,2) of SO(4) = SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R gives Q = +1, 0, 0, -1. With 6 color states (3+3bar), sum(Q^2)_colored = 12 = dim(SM) = n_c + 1.

3. **[CONJECTURE] Three equivalent interpretations of 1/n_c**: (a) Channel fraction: EM = 1/n_c of crystal. (b) SM/crystal ratio: dim(SM)/n_c = 12/11. (c) 1/n_c expansion: C = 2 + 2/n_c. All equivalent because dim(SM) = n_c + 1.

4. **[CONJECTURE] sum(Q^2) = dim(SM) = 12**: This is a structural coincidence within the framework. Requires specific SO(4) charge assignments AND color multiplicity 3+3bar = 6. The fact that 2*6 = 12 = 1+3+8 is not automatic.

5. **[DERIVED] Residual is 0.8x three-loop scale**: After C = 24/11, the remaining gap 3.1e-8 is comparable to alpha^3/pi^2 = 3.9e-8. A natural three-loop correction could account for it.

6. **[CONJECTURE] Derivation chain status**: Steps 1-5 (counting 24) are [DERIVED/THEOREM]. Step 6 (1/n_c) is [CONJECTURE] -- this is the remaining gap in EQ-039.

## Open Questions

1. **1/n_c from generator algebra** (EQ-039 reduced): Can the channel fraction be derived from the embedding of U(1)_EM in U(n_c)? The democratic metric (Schur's lemma) might provide the link.
2. **Three-loop coefficient**: Residual is 0.8x alpha^3/pi^2. Can a three-loop coefficient C_3 be predicted from the composite sector? Would give a PREDICTION.
3. **sin^2 one-loop coefficient**: Can Band A's correction coefficient be computed from composite sector particle content?
4. **Why sum(Q^2) = dim(SM)?**: The numerical coincidence 2*6 = 12 = 1+3+8 seems deep. Is there a representation-theoretic reason?

## Key Context for Next Session

EQ-039 is now PARTIALLY RESOLVED: the number 24 is derived from group theory, the number 11 is derived from CCP, but the specific COMBINATION C = 24/11 depends on the 1/n_c channel fraction which remains [CONJECTURE]. Three interpretations point to 1/n_c (channel fraction, SM/crystal ratio, 1/n_c expansion) but none prove it rigorously.

The strongest direction for further progress: derive 1/n_c from the democratic metric / Schur's lemma framework (connecting to EQ-007 and the I-STRUCT-5 structure adopted in S233). Alternatively, predict the three-loop coefficient from the composite spectrum.
