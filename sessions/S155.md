# Session 155 — Weinberg Running Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Focus**: 121-vs-126 denominator tension — SM running test
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S154 (Weinberg angle investigation), S153 (5C+5D unification)
**Next**: —

## Outcome

Running reconciliation hypothesis **FALSIFIED**. sin^2(theta_W) increases with energy (toward GUT 3/8). Both formulas are electroweak-scale predictions targeting different definitions. 17/17 PASS.

## Key Findings

1. **sin^2(theta_W) INCREASES with energy** (toward GUT value 3/8). At 405 TeV: 0.275. Running goes the WRONG direction for reconciliation.
2. **Both formulas are EW-scale predictions**:
   - 28/121 = 0.2314 matches SM running at mu = 94.6 GeV (just above M_Z)
   - 29/126 = 0.2302 matches SM running at mu = 73.7 GeV (below M_Z)
   - Energy gap: factor 1.28
3. **Measured value sits BETWEEN the two formulas.** Neither exactly right at M_Z; they bracket it.
4. **cos(theta_W) = 171/194 is ON-SHELL** (matches M_W/M_Z), distinct from MS-bar. The 3.5% difference is standard radiative corrections.
5. **Algebraic structure**: 28/121 - 29/126 = 19/(n_c^2 * C * Im_H^2 * Im_O), where 19 = n_d^2 + Im_H = n_c + O.

## Key Context for Continuation

The question is no longer "which scale?" but **"which physical mechanism?"** The formulas represent different structural aspects:
- 28/121: Goldstone fraction (N_Goldstone/n_c^2)
- 29/126: Charge-weighted sum (S_2/(S_EM+n_c))
- 171/194: On-shell mass ratio

Three open tasks remain:
- **Task B** [HIGH]: Derive S_2=29 from SO(11) representation theory
- **Task D** [MEDIUM]: Correction terms for alpha_2 and alpha_s
- **Task E** [MEDIUM]: Compute Tr(Y^2)/Tr(T^2) for SO(11)
