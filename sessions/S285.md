# Session S285: Yang-Mills — Large-N Correction + Exotic 1+- + Tree-Dressed Bands

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Focus**: Large-N 1/N^2 correction derivation, SU(N) exotic comparison, tree-dressed band classification
**Topic**: Gauge theory / Yang-Mills
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S284 (Yang-Mills: SU(N) generalization + CANONICAL promotion)
**Next**: Extract AT2021 per-N exotic data; excitation cost dressing; or new topic

---

## Outcome

Three-direction session extending the CANONICAL Yang-Mills investigation. (1) **Large-N intercept** identified as 10/3 = Im_H + 1/Im_H, matching lattice 3.37(15) at 1.2%. Combined formula m(0++, N) = 10/3 + 2/N^2 fits SU(2)-SU(5) with chi^2 = 0.47 and ZERO free parameters. The tree-to-large-N correction is 2/N_c (a 1/N_c planar correction). (2) **Exotic 1+-** dressed prediction at SU(3) is 59/9 = 6.556, falling between the two lattice values (6.25-6.66). The m = 4+N formula has a large-N divergence (regime of validity: N ~ 3-6). Per-N AT2021 data not extractable from web sources. (3) **Band classification**: All glueball gaps are Band A (one-loop QCD, 0.7-5.1%). Dressed base dramatically improves 0++ across SU(N) (12% -> 0.9%) but not excited states (error cancellation in tree formula).

## Key Findings

1. **Large-N intercept = 10/3** [CONJECTURE]: m(0++, N=inf) = Im_H + 1/Im_H = (Im_H^2+1)/Im_H = n_d - 2/N_c = 10/3 = 3.333. Matches lattice 3.37(15) at 0.2 sigma. The tree-level value n_d=4 is corrected by 2/N_c (planar leading-order).

2. **n_d - Im_O/n_c = 37/11 = 3.3636** [NOTED]: Even closer at 0.04 sigma, but lacks structural depth. The 10/3 form has 5+ equivalent framework expressions.

3. **Combined 0++ formula** [CONJECTURE]: m(0++, N) = 10/3 + dim_C/N^2 = 10/3 + 2/N^2. Chi^2 = 0.47 (4 points, 0 free params). Systematically better than n_d=4 for SU(3)-SU(5).

4. **Dressed 1+- at SU(3)** [CONJECTURE]: 10/3 + 2/9 + Im_H = 59/9 = 6.556. Between Chen (6.66, 1.6% error) and AT2020 (6.25, 4.9% error).

5. **Large-N 1+- tension** [KNOWN LIMITATION]: m(1+-) = 4+N diverges; lattice M_adj = 5.753(10) is finite. Regime of validity: N ~ 3-6 for exotic states, paralleling L>=2 breakdown.

6. **Band A classification** [DERIVATION]: All 6 SU(3) glueball gaps are 0.7-5.1% (5/6 strictly Band A, 2-+ at 0.7% borderline). Physical reason: pure gauge = only alpha_s corrections. No Band B/C expected.

7. **Base-only dressing asymmetry**: Dressed base improves 0++ (12% -> 0.9% avg across SU(N)) but worsens excited SU(3) states. Tree formula benefits from cancellation between overestimated base and implicit excitation corrections.

8. **Constituent model M(1+-) = 2*Im_H = 6**: At large-N in adjoint units, the 3-gluon constituent model gives M=6, exactly 2*Im_H. Matches lattice 5.753 at 4.3%.

## Open Questions

1. **AT2021 per-N exotic data**: The Athenodorou-Teper 2021 paper has SU(N) 1+- data for N=2-12 but tables couldn't be extracted from web sources. Need PDF access for blind prediction comparison.
2. **Excitation cost dressing**: Can J(J+1)/n_d and dim_C*L be dressed analogously to the base mass? Would require per-state SU(N) data.
3. **n_d - Im_O/n_c = 37/11**: Is this 0.04-sigma match to the large-N intercept meaningful or numerological? It lacks the structural depth of 10/3.

## Key Context for Next Session

The Yang-Mills investigation has 285/286 PASS across 13 scripts. Key new result: the combined formula m(0++, N) = 10/3 + 2/N^2 gives chi^2 = 0.47 with 0 free parameters for SU(2)-SU(5) lattice data. The large-N intercept 10/3 = Im_H + 1/Im_H connects to the N_c self-dual form. The exotic 1+- has a regime-of-validity limitation at large N (parallels L>=2 breakdown). All glueball gaps are Band A. Next high-value step: obtain AT2021 per-N data for 1+- blind prediction comparison, or move to a different topic.
