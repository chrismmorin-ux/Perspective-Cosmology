# Session 214: S210/S212 Open Questions — kappa_lambda, nu_R, and Assessment

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Collider-crystallization — remaining open questions from S210/S212
**Topic**: `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Previous**: S212 (fermion embedding resolved: spinorial/MCHM4)

## Outcome

Addressed all 5 open questions from S210/S212. Derived and verified the triple Higgs self-coupling kappa_lambda = (1-2xi)/sqrt(1-xi) = 113/(11*sqrt(117)) = 0.9497 (5.03% below SM) via symbolic differentiation of the MCHM4 potential (20/20 PASS). Also computed the quartic kappa_4 ≈ 0.726 (27.4% deviation). Formalized the nu_R structural prediction from the spinor 32 decomposition, connecting to S167 neutrino mass predictions (19/19 PASS). Assessed the three deeper questions (xi from dynamics, top Yukawa, colored pNGB mass) — all blocked on specifying composite sector dynamics, with paths identified.

## Key Findings

1. **[DERIVATION] kappa_lambda = (1-2xi)/sqrt(1-xi) = 0.9497**: Derived from the MCHM4 sin²+sin⁴ potential via symbolic differentiation (no manual algebra). This is 5.03% below SM — a 3x larger deviation than kappa_V (1.67%). Testable at FCC-hh (~1σ) but not HL-LHC. Framework expression: 113/(11*sqrt(117)). New falsification entry F-COL-5 registered.

2. **[DERIVATION] kappa_4 ≈ 0.726 (quartic self-coupling)**: 27.4% deviation from SM. The quartic modifier formula is (-28xi² + 28xi - 3)/(3(xi-1)). Extremely difficult to measure but shows composite Higgs potential is significantly flatter than SM.

3. **[DERIVATION] nu_R is a structural prediction**: The SO(11) spinor 32 = 16 + 16', where 16 = 15 SM + 1 nu_R. The right-handed neutrino is REQUIRED to complete the half-spinor — it is not optional. Division algebra origin: nu_R corresponds to dim(R) = 1, the simplest algebra with no internal structure matching the unique gauge singlet (1,1,0). Exactly 3 nu_R predicted (one per generation, from Im_H = 3).

4. **[ASSESSMENT] xi derivation: BLOCKED**: Four paths identified (geometric volume fraction, extremal/fixed point, counting argument, full CW). All require new physical arguments. Geometric path (xi = dim(defect)/dim(crystal)²) most promising.

5. **[ASSESSMENT] y_t and colored pNGB mass: BLOCKED**: Top Yukawa requires partial compositeness parameters (UV dynamics). Colored pNGB mass needs N_CW from composite sector specification. The observation that N_CW = 8 = dim(O) is suggestive but speculative.

## Open Questions for Continuation

1. **Derive xi = n_d/n_c² from vacuum alignment**: Geometric volume fraction argument is most promising path. Requires new physical insight, not blocked on computation.
2. **Top Yukawa from SO(11)**: Needs partial compositeness calculation with specific composite sector dynamics. BLOCKED on UV completion.
3. **Colored pNGB mass from first principles**: N_CW = 8 = dim(O) is suggestive. Could formalize this connection but currently speculative. BLOCKED on dynamics.
4. **95 GeV scalar excess**: Most dangerous active anomaly (S213). Framework predicts NO scalar at 95 GeV. Full Run 3 data will resolve.

## Key Context for Next Session

All 5 open questions from S210/S212 have been addressed. Two were computationally resolved (kappa_lambda, nu_R), three assessed and classified as blocked on dynamics. The EWSB/collider sector now has 5 falsification entries (F-COL-1 through F-COL-5) plus the structural nu_R prediction. The remaining frontier is deriving xi from dynamics — this is the deepest open question in the EWSB sector and likely requires a fundamentally new argument connecting the framework's algebraic structure to vacuum alignment.
