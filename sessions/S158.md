# Session 158 — 2026-01-30

**Focus**: GUT trace + crystallization mechanism + LEP Z-pole
**Topic**: `topics/weinberg-angle.md`, `topics/collider-crystallization.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE (retroactive stub — session file was never written)
**Previous**: S157 (Casimir completeness audit)
**Next**: S159 (S_2=29 derivation)

## Note

This session file was reconstructed from `registry/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md` handoff notes during the Session 176 documentation audit. The original session file was never created.

## Outcome

3 findings, 3 scripts (47/47 PASS total).

## Key Findings

1. **GUT trace CLOSED** — Standard GUT trace formula gives sin²θ_W = 1/2 or 3/8, never 28/121. Democratic mode counting in U(11) gives 28/121 instead.
2. **Crystallization mechanism PROPOSED** — Democratic mode counting in U(11) gives sin²θ_W = 28/121.
3. **LEP Z-pole CONSISTENT** — All observables match at Born level; g_V^e = -Im_H²/(2n_c²); 28/121 within 0.8σ of LEP.

## Gaps Identified

- 1/α_2 = 31.7 vs 29.6 (7% discrepancy)
- Strong coupling doesn't follow same counting

## Open Questions

1. One-loop Lagrangian derivation of 1/g_i² ~ N_i
2. Radiative corrections to 1/α_2
3. Scheme identification for 28/121
