# Session 237: EQ-002 Omega_m = 63/200 Mechanism Investigation

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: EQ-002 — Derive Omega_m = 63/200 from physical mechanism
**Topic**: CMB physics / cosmology
**Status**: COMPLETE — no mechanism found; structural insight documented
**Previous**: S230 (CC sign resolution, EQ-002 unblocked), S199 (CMB audit)

---

## Outcome

Investigated whether Omega_m = 63/200 can be derived from a physical mechanism rather than algebraic pattern-matching. Found a **new structural decomposition** (63 = dim(su(4)) + dim(su(7)) = dim(su(8))), but confirmed that crystallization dynamics gaps are too large to support a mechanism derivation. EQ-002 status remains OPEN [CONJECTURE].

## Key Findings

1. **Triple formula conflict quantified** [ANALYSIS]: 137/200 and 13/19 differ by 0.12% (10.8% of Planck error bar). Both within 1-sigma. Incompatible as exact values — at most one can be the true prediction. No principled way to select between them.

2. **63 = dim(su(4)) + dim(su(7))** [NEW, CONJECTURE]: The matter numerator 63 equals the sum of traceless endomorphisms of both subspaces in V = R^4 + R^7 = R^11. This gives End(V) = 121 = 63 (su(4)+su(7)) + 56 (2x coset) + 2 (trace). More structurally motivated than original 7x9 decomposition.

3. **63 = dim(su(8)) = O^2 - 1** [NEW, CONJECTURE]: The dimensional coincidence su(4)+su(7) = su(8) holds because H^2 + Im_O^2 = O^2 + 1, which is **specific to O = 8** (only division algebra dimension satisfying this). Not accidental.

4. **Denominator problem unresolved**: Numerator 63 comes from End(V) decomposition; denominator 200 comes from H_0 identity (337 = 137 + 200). Different mathematical objects with no unified origin.

5. **Coincidence problem unresolved**: Omega_m is epoch-dependent (changes with z). Framework gives static ratio for z=0 value. No mechanism explains "why now."

6. **Crystallization dynamics gaps assessed**: Missing ε(t) evolution in FRW, energy partition mechanism, crystallization-to-Friedmann bridge, V_0 amplitude, baryon asymmetry. These block any credible mechanism derivation. Attempting would be circular.

## Open Questions

1. **Triple formula resolution** (EQ-002 related): Which of 137/200 vs 13/19 is correct? Needs future Planck/DESI precision to distinguish (0.12% difference).
2. **Denominator unification**: Can 200 = O x (R+H)^2 be derived from the same End(V) structure that gives 63?
3. **Crystallization-to-Friedmann bridge**: Requires ε(t) evolution equation in FRW cosmology — prerequisite for any mechanism derivation.
4. **su(4)+su(7) physical interpretation**: Can the identification "traceless endomorphisms = matter modes" be justified beyond dimensional counting?

## Key Context for Next Session

The su(4)+su(7) decomposition is the best structural interpretation of the numerator 63, but it does NOT constitute a derivation. Three blockers prevent a mechanism: (1) no unified origin for numerator and denominator, (2) Omega_m is epoch-dependent but the formula is static, (3) crystallization dynamics lacks the machinery (ε(t) in FRW, energy partition, V_0) to compute energy density ratios from first principles. The S94-S126 failure to find a mechanism is now understood as reflecting genuine framework gaps, not just lack of effort. Reattempting requires: ε(t) evolution in expanding cosmology, energy partition from crystallization potential, and V_0 derivation.
