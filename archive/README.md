## Why Keep Archives?

1. **Intellectual honesty** — Document what was tried, not just what worked
2. **Historical record** — Track evolution of thinking
3. **Prevent repetition** — Don't re-explore dead ends
4. **Reference** — Original data and calculations may be useful

## For Current Work

**Start with**: `registry/STATUS_DASHBOARD.md`

**Complete theory**: `THEORY_STRUCTURE.md`

**See also**: `CLAUDE.md` for workflow guidelines
