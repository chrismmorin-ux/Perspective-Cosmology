# IMP_0600 Import: Complex Field

**Tag**: 0600
**Type**: IMPORT
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: framework/layer_2_correspondence.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0205: Value space V]

## Provides

- 𝔽 = ℂ: V is a complex vector space

---

## Statement

**I-DIM-1**: The value space V is defined over the complex numbers.

```
V is a complex inner product space
```

---

## Justification

- QM requires complex amplitudes for interference
- U(1) phase rotations need ℂ
- Real numbers insufficient for QM dynamics

---

## Classification

**ESSENTIAL** — framework cannot reproduce QM without it.

---

## Notes

Could potentially be derived if interference patterns require ℂ.
Currently imported from QM.
