# IMP_0606 Import: Planck Time

**Tag**: 0606
**Type**: IMPORT
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: framework/layer_2_correspondence.md

---

## Requires

- [AXM_0108: Fundamental time scale τ₀]

## Provides

- τ₀ = t_P = 5.4×10⁻⁴⁴ s

---

## Statement

**I-SCALE-2**: The fundamental time scale is identified with Planck time.

---

## Justification

- Natural time unit from fundamental constants
- τ₀ = √(ℏG/c⁵) = 5.39×10⁻⁴⁴ s
- Smallest meaningful time interval

---

## Classification

**CONVENIENT** — simplest physical identification.

---

## Notes

Suggestive relationship: τ₀ ~ t_H/√|Π|
This is not derived, just observed to be approximately consistent.
