## Files Still Active in physics/

The following files were NOT archived (contain unique active investigations):

- `field_content_from_orthogonality.md` — Active field emergence investigation
- `asymptotic_safety_connection.md` — Asymptotic safety connection
- `alpha_crystal_interface.md` — Crystal-defect interface mechanism
- `tilt_matrix_alpha_derivation.md` — Tilt-to-alpha mapping
- `intermediate_gamma.md` — Intermediate regime physics
- `intermediate_gamma_analysis.md` — Intermediate regime analysis
- `penrose_diosi_comparison.md` — Literature connection

## Why These Were Archived

These files represent exploratory work from Sessions 20-50. The framework has since:
- Achieved sub-ppm precision on multiple constants (vs. order-of-magnitude estimates)
- Established verification scripts for all claims
- Developed systematic prime attractor theory
- Created four-layer structure (axioms → math → correspondence → predictions)

**For historical reference only. See `framework/` for current work.**
