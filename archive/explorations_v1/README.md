### Current Prime Theory Documents

- `framework/investigations/prime_crystallization_attractors.md` — Why low primes crystallize more
- `framework/investigations/primes_and_recrystallization_unified.md` — Crystal = prime space
- `framework/PRIME_PHYSICAL_CATALOG.md` — All 8 framework primes mapped
- `framework/investigations/prime_emergence_from_perspective_axioms.md` — Formal derivation

## Verification Scripts (Still Active)

The Python scripts from primes_from_orthogonality/ are preserved in `verification/sympy/`:
- `orthogonality_analysis.py` — Coprimality = orthogonality verification
- `dimensional_generator.py` — Prime generation
- `cascade_optimization.py` — Prediction accuracy tests

---

## Key Results Preserved

From FINAL_SUMMARY.md (now archived):
- Coprimality = orthogonality: **VERIFIED** (37,527 tests)
- Cascade prediction: **47.5% accuracy**
- Search space reduction: **80%**

These results are now superseded by the theoretical framework achieving sub-ppm constant derivations.
