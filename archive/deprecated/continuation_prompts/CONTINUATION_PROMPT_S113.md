Continue Session 113 of the Perspective Cosmology framework.

## What Was Completed

Session 113 explored horizon thermodynamics and cosmic structure:

1. **Hawking radiation analysis** - Factor 8 = O (octonion), factor 15360 = 15 × 2^10
2. **BH/dS entropy ratio** - S_dS/S_BH = 231/16 = (Im_H × Im_O × n_c) / n_d²
3. **The number 231** - 231 = 3×7×11 = T_21 (21st triangular) = dim(so(22))
4. **SO(22) connection** - 22 = C × n_c (complexified crystal), de Sitter has so(22) symmetry
5. **Local/global dichotomy** - BH uses powers of 2 (division algebras), dS uses primes (crystallization)
6. **Key identity** - n_c - n_d = Im_O (crystal minus spacetime = imaginary octonion)

## Verification Scripts Created (All PASS)

- `verification/sympy/special_mass_scales_bh.py` — 7/7 PASS
- `verification/sympy/number_231_cosmic_significance.py` — 10/10 PASS
- `verification/sympy/power_of_two_cosmic_factors.py` — 10/10 PASS
- `verification/sympy/so22_and_doubled_crystal.py` — 9/9 PASS

## Key Formulas Discovered

| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 231 = dim(so(22)) | dS entropy = Lie algebra dimension |
| 22 = C × n_c | Complexified crystal |
| n_c - n_d = Im_O = 7 | Crystal - spacetime = im. octonion |
| 15360 = 15 × 2^10 | Hawking power = div.alg × 2^(Goldstone) |
| S_dS/S_BH = 231/16 | Crystallization / spacetime² |

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Investigate so(22) and holography** - Does doubled crystal have AdS/CFT interpretation?
2. **Goldstone count 10 = n_c - 1** - Where else does this appear?
3. **Experimental signatures** - Compile testable predictions from RESEARCH_NAVIGATOR
4. **Running couplings** - Beta function coefficients were found in S105, continue that thread

## Framework Constants Reference

- n_d = 4 (spacetime), n_c = 11 (crystal)
- C = 2, H = 4, O = 8 (division algebras)
- Im_H = 3, Im_O = 7 (imaginary dimensions)
- 37 = H_sum = 1+2+4+8+22 (bootstrap), 79 = cosmic total
