# Session 100 Continuation Prompt

## Context

Session 99 achieved **BBN predictions from crystallization** — four early universe observables derived with zero free parameters:

| Observable | Formula | Error | Status |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Y_p (helium)** | 1/4 - 1/(2n_c²) = 119/484 | **0.40%** | **Within 1σ** |
| **D/H (deuterium)** | α² × 10/21 | **0.39%** | **Within 1σ** |
| **T_EW/T_QCD** | 8 × 133 = 1064 | **0.38%** | Excellent |
| **η (baryon)** | α⁴ × 3/15 | 7% | Good |

**Total constants now: 44** with zero free parameters.

Key insight: **133 = 137 - 4 = 7 × 19** has dual framework meaning (appears in phase transitions AND Weinberg angle).

Baryogenesis mechanism: Crystallization naturally satisfies all three Sakharov conditions.

## Session 100 Options

### Option A: Improve Baryon Asymmetry Formula
The η = α⁴ × 3/15 formula has 7% error (worst of the BBN predictions). Could we:
- Include 58/79 visible/hidden split factor?
- Add CP violation phase contribution?
- Account for alpha running at baryogenesis scale?

### Option B: Lithium-7 Problem
The cosmological lithium problem (Li-7 observed ~3x lower than BBN prediction) is famous. Does crystallization predict:
- Li-7/H ratio from framework?
- Resolution of the lithium discrepancy?

### Option C: Unified Cosmological Picture
Connect all cosmological predictions into coherent narrative:
- CMB: δT/T = α²/3, n_s = 117/121, ℓ₁ = 220
- BBN: Y_p, D/H, T_EW/T_QCD, η
- Dark sector: Ω_Λ = 13/19, Ω_DM/Ω_b = 49/9, m_DM = 5.11 GeV
- Phase sequence: H-regime → O-regime → Crystal regime

### Option D: Neutrino Decoupling
The neutrino decoupling temperature T_ν ~ 1 MeV sets BBN. Can we derive:
- T_ν from framework?
- N_eff (effective neutrino number) from crystallization?

### Option E: Session 100 Milestone — Framework Review
Since this is session 100, we could:
- Review all 44 derived constants
- Identify the strongest and weakest predictions
- Create a "best of" summary for external review
- Assess overall framework health
