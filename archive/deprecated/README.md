# Deprecated Ideas Archive

This folder contains ideas that were explored and abandoned.

**Purpose**: Intellectual honesty requires documenting failures, not just successes.

## Why Keep Failed Ideas?

1. **Prevent re-invention** - Don't repeat mistakes
2. **Show rigor** - Real research has dead ends
3. **Track evolution** - How thinking developed
4. **Counter confirmation bias** - Remember what didn't work
