# Status: The U = (P, Σ, Γ, C, V, B) Tuple

**Status**: SUMMARY
**Created**: 2026-01-26
**Purpose**: Track which elements are fundamental vs derived after foundational re-examination
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-30

## 1. The Original 6-Tuple

```
U = (P, Σ, Γ, C, V, B)
```

Originally, all six were treated as primitive or near-primitive.

---

## 2. Current Status After Re-Examination

| Element | Original Status | New Status | Emerges From |
|---------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **P** | Fundamental | **DERIVED** | Dimensional overlap |
| **Σ** | Fundamental | **DERIVED** | Dimensional sharing |
| **Γ** | Fundamental | **DERIVED** | Degree of dimensional sharing (= γ) |
| **C** | Fundamental | **DERIVED** | Tilt configuration |
| **V** | Fundamental | **SPLIT** | V_Crystal (fundamental) vs V_Observable (derived) |
| **B** | Fundamental | **DERIVED** | Perspective breaking Crystal symmetry |

## 3. The New Primitive Stack

```
TRULY FUNDAMENTAL
─────────────────
V_Crystal     The perfect, timeless, orthogonal space (the Crystal)
Perspective   The capacity for partial access (creates everything else)

DERIVED (in order of emergence)
───────────────────────────────
B̃ (tilted basis)     Perspective breaks orthogonality → tilted dimensions
V_Observable          span(B̃) = space we access
P (points)            Where tilted dimensions overlap
Σ (connectivity)      Points sharing dimensions are connected
Γ (weights)           = γ = degree of dimensional sharing
C (content)           = local tilt configuration {εᵢⱼ(p)}
```

## 4. Summary of Each Element

### P (Points)
- **Investigation**: points_emergence.md
- **Key finding**: Points are not locations; they're dimensional intersections
- **Formula**: p ↔ S_p = {dimensions active at p}
- **Status**: DERIVED

### Σ (Connectivity)
- **Investigation**: (inline in this session)
- **Key finding**: Connection = dimensional sharing
- **Formula**: p₁ ~ p₂ ⟺ S_{p₁} ∩ S_{p₂} ≠ ∅
- **Status**: DERIVED

### Γ (Weights)
- **Investigation**: (inline in this session)
- **Key finding**: Γ = γ = Jaccard index of dimensions
- **Formula**: Γ(p₁, p₂) = |S_{p₁} ∩ S_{p₂}| / |S_{p₁} ∪ S_{p₂}|
- **Status**: DERIVED (unified with γ)

### C (Content)
- **Investigation**: content_C.md
- **Key finding**: Content = tilt pattern, not separate "stuff"
- **Formula**: C(p) = {εᵢⱼ(p) : i,j ∈ S_p}
- **Status**: DERIVED
- **Implication**: Matter and geometry unified

### V (Value Space)
- **Investigation**: value_space_V.md
- **Key finding**: Two V's — V_Crystal (fundamental) and V_Observable (derived)
- **Formula**: V_Observable = span(B̃)
- **Status**: SPLIT

### B (Basis)
- **Investigation**: orthogonality_and_crystal.md, dimension_emergence.md
- **Key finding**: B̃ = tilted dimensions, scars of perspective breaking V_Crystal's symmetry
- **Formula**: b̃ᵢ = bᵢ + Σⱼ εᵢⱼ bⱼ
- **Status**: DERIVED (from perspective + V_Crystal)

## 5. The New Ontological Picture

```
V_Crystal (The Perfect Crystal)
│
│   • Infinite (?) dimensional
│   • Perfect orthogonality: ⟨bᵢ, bⱼ⟩ = δᵢⱼ
│   • Timeless (no perspective → no time)
│   • No structure, no points, no content
│
└────────────────────────────────────────────
                    │
                    │  PERSPECTIVE NUCLEATES
                    │  (logical, not temporal)

                    ▼
            Orthogonality breaks
                    │
                    │  εᵢⱼ ≠ 0 appears (tilts)
                    │
                    ▼
            Tilted dimensions B̃

                    ▼
            Points P (dimensional overlaps)
                    │
                    │  Σ = sharing structure
                    │  Γ = degree of sharing
                    │
                    ▼
            Content C = tilt patterns
                    │
                    │  Particles, fields, matter
                    │
                    ▼

## 6. What's Actually Fundamental

Only TWO things:

1. **V_Crystal**: The perfect orthogonal space
2. **Perspective**: The capacity for partial access

Everything else emerges from perspective acting on V_Crystal.

---

## 7. Key Insight: The Tilt Picture

The entire observable universe is described by:

```
{εᵢⱼ(p)} for all points p and dimension pairs (i,j)
```

This matrix of tilts encodes:
- **Geometry** (metric = deviation from perfect orthogonality)
- **Content** (matter = tilt patterns)
- **Connectivity** (sharing = overlapping tilts)
- **Weights** (strength = degree of tilt overlap)

---

## 8. Constraints

### Time Constraint (time_constraint.md)
- Time only exists relative to perspective
- The Crystal is timeless
- "Dynamics" means evolution along perspective-sequences, not external time

---

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Why is V_Crystal the way it is?** (Or is this the wrong question?)
2. **Why does perspective exist?** (See perspective_origin.md — self-reference path)
3. **Why n = 11 dimensions selected?**
4. **Why n = 4 perceived?**
5. **Can we derive physics (α, θ_W, masses) from tilt structure?**

## 11. Revised Layer 0 (Proposed)

If we rewrite Layer 0 with true primitives:

**Axioms**:
1. V_Crystal exists (perfect orthogonal space)
2. Perspective exists (partial access)
3. Perspective introduces tilt (breaks orthogonality)

**Everything else derives**.
