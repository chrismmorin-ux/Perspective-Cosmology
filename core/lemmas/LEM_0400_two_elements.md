# LEM_0400 Lemma: Two Elements

**Tag**: 0400
**Type**: LEMMA
**Status**: CANONICAL

## Requires

- [AXM_0102: Non-Triviality]

## Provides

- |P| ≥ 2

---

## Statement

**Lemma U.1**: P has at least 2 elements.

---

## Proof

By AXM_0102 (Non-Triviality):
```
∃ p, q ∈ P : C(p) ≠ C(q)
```

Since p ≠ q (otherwise C(p) = C(q)), we have at least two distinct points.

## Notes

A trivial but essential consequence establishing minimum universe size.
