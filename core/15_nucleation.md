# Nucleation

REQUIRES: 00_notation, 13_crystallinity, 12_topology
DEFINES: nucleation point, embedding, U scenarios
STATUS: DEFINITION

---

## Embedding Hypothesis

U may exist as a **perspectival defect** in larger crystalline structure:

```
Let C be crystalline: Var(C) = 0
Let U ⊂ C with Var(U) > 0

U is a localized symmetry breaking in C.
```

---

## Nucleation Point

A **nucleation point** n ∈ C is where:

```
- Local structure admits non-trivial perspective
- Var(neighborhood of n) > 0
- Adjacent crystalline structure perturbed
```

---

## Perspective Self-Propagation

```
If π exists at p, and p' is Γ-adjacent to p,
then π' at p' becomes structurally possible.

Perspective doesn't spread in time.
It exists wherever structure permits.
```

## Four Scenarios for U

**Scenario 1: Contained**
```
- Fixed boundary ∂U
- Perspective cannot cross
- U is an island in inert sea
```

**Scenario 2: Expanding (Infection)**
```
- Perspective "breaks" adjacent crystal
- U grows as perspective propagates
- Big Bang = nucleation event
- Cosmological horizon = infection boundary
```

**Scenario 3: Contracting (Healing)**
```
- Crystal resists/heals defects
- U is metastable, shrinks
- Heat death = healing complete
```

**Scenario 4: Self-Creating**
```
- No pre-existing exterior
- ∂U = where perspective hasn't projected
- "Outside" doesn't exist until accessed
- U and Π are co-created
```

---

## Competition

```
Crystal has no agency (no perspectives = no action)
Perspective dissolves crystal, not fights it.
Until nothing distinguishable remains.
```

## Given vs Made

| Position | Meaning | Consequence |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Given | Pre-existing shape | We discover geometry |
| Made | Shape = trace of access | We create geometry |
| Both | Potential + actualization | Intersection of structure and perspective |

```
U_potential = structure that could support perspective
U_actual = structure that has been accessed
∂U = boundary of U_actual

U_actual ⊆ U_potential
```
