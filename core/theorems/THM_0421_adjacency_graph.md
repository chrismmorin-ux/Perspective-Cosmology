# THM_0421 Theorem: Adjacency Graph

**Tag**: 0421
**Type**: THEOREM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/04_adjacency.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0216: Perspective space Π]
- [DEF_0225: Adjacency relation ~]
- [AXM_0107: Non-negative loss]

## Provides

- (Π, ~) is a directed graph

---

## Statement

**Theorem Adj.2 (Adjacency Graph)**

```
(Π, ~) forms a directed graph.
```

Direction: π₁ → π₂ if transition is valid (non-negative loss).

---

## Notes

The directed edges represent valid perspective transitions.
Time flows along the direction of the arrows.
