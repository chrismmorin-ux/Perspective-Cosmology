# THM_0470 Theorem: Critical Slowing

**Tag**: 0470
**Type**: THEOREM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/18_dynamics.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_02A1: Decoherence rate]

## Provides

- Decoherence rate vanishes at γ = 0.5

---

## Statement

**Theorem D.1 (Critical Slowing)**

```
At γ = 0.5, Γ_dec = 0.
```

---

## Proof

```
Γ_dec = (1 - 2×0.5)/τ₀ = 0/τ₀ = 0
```

QED

---

## Notes

At the critical overlap, there is no intrinsic decoherence tendency.
