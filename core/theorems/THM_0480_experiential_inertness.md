# THM_0480 Theorem: Experiential Inertness

**Tag**: 0480
**Type**: THEOREM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/13_crystallinity.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0285: Crystalline]
- [DEF_0260: Temporal sequence]

## Provides

- Crystalline structures are experientially inert

---

## Statement

**Theorem C.1**

```
If Var(U) = 0, all temporal sequences are experientially equivalent.
```

"Time passes" but nothing distinguishes moments.

---

## Proof

If Var(U) = 0, then ∀ π₁, π₂: U_{π₁} ≅ U_{π₂}.

All perspectives reveal the same content structure.

No transition can distinguish "before" from "after".
