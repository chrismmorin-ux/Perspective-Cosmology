# THM_0411 Theorem: Non-Invertibility of Access

**Tag**: 0411
**Type**: THEOREM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/03_propagation.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0222: Receptive subspace]
- [DEF_0224: Access map construction]

## Provides

- A_π is not invertible

---

## Statement

**Theorem Pr.1 (Non-Invertibility)**

```
A_π is not invertible.
```

---

## Proof

1. Π_p loses dimensions if V_p ⊊ V
2. (P_D)^n ignores paths not in D
3. Multiple C, C' can yield A_π(C) = A_π(C')

QED

## Notes

This theorem confirms that access necessarily loses information.
It's consistent with AXM_0106 (Non-Invertibility).
