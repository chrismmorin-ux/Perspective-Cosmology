# THM_0442 Theorem: Projection Trace

**Tag**: 0442
**Type**: THEOREM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/06_basis_geometry.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0243: Projection operators]
- [DEF_0244: Dimension counting]

## Provides

- Tr(Π_i) = n_i

---

## Statement

**Theorem B.3 (Trace)**

```
Tr(Π_i) = dim(V_i) = n_i
```

---

## Proof

The trace of a projection equals the dimension of its range.
Since Π_i projects onto V_i:

Tr(Π_i) = dim(V_i) = n_i

## Notes

Standard linear algebra result.
