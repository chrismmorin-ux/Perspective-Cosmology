# THM_0440 Theorem: Automorphism Decomposition

**Tag**: 0440
**Type**: THEOREM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/06_basis_geometry.md

## Requires

- [DEF_0241: Automorphisms of B]
- [DEF_0242: Subspace decomposition]

## Provides

- Aut(B) decomposes as product

---

## Statement

**Theorem B.1 (Aut Decomposition)**

```
Aut(B) = Aut(B_1) × Aut(B_2) × ... × Aut(B_k)
```

when B_i are invariant under Aut(B).

## Notes

This is a standard result from group theory.
Each subspace has its own independent automorphism group.
