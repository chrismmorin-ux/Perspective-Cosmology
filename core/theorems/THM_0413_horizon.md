# THM_0413 Theorem: Horizon

**Tag**: 0413
**Type**: THEOREM
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Source**: core/03_propagation.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0204: Connectivity weights Γ]
- [THM_0412: Attenuation]

## Provides

- Concept of information horizon

---

## Statement

**Theorem Pr.3 (Horizon)**

```
If Γ = 1 on some edges, information propagates indefinitely.
Define horizon H as truncation scale.
```

---

## Notes

**Status**: ACTIVE — definition of H needs formalization.

When some weights equal 1, attenuation doesn't occur along those paths.
The horizon H represents a practical cutoff for computational purposes.
