# AXM_0100 Axiom: Finiteness

**Tag**: 0100
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/01_universe.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0202: Points P]
- [DEF_0205: Value space V]

## Provides

- Finiteness constraint on universe

---

## Statement

**U1 (Finiteness)**

```
|P| < ∞  and  dim(V) < ∞
```

The set of points is finite, and the value space is finite-dimensional.

## Notes

This axiom ensures all quantities in the framework are computable.
It rules out continuous limits at the foundational level.
