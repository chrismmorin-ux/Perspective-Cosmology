# AXM_0101 Axiom: Connectivity

**Tag**: 0101
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/01_universe.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0202: Points P]
- [DEF_0203: Simplicial complex Σ]

## Provides

- Graph connectivity of universe

---

## Statement

**U2 (Connectivity)**

```
The graph (P, Σ_1) is connected
```

Any two points can be reached via a path of 1-simplices (edges).

---

## Notes

This ensures the universe is a single connected component.
Combined with finiteness, any point is reachable in finitely many steps.
