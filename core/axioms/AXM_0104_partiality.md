# AXM_0104 Axiom: Partiality

**Tag**: 0104
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/02_perspective.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0201: Universe tuple U]
- [DEF_0214: Accessible content U_π]

## Provides

- Perspectives are always partial

---

## Statement

**A1 (Partiality)**

```
U_π ⊊ U
```

Every perspective has hidden content.

---

## Notes

This is a fundamental axiom of the framework.
It asserts that no perspective has complete knowledge of U.
Combined with DEF_0215, it means H_π ≠ ∅ always.
