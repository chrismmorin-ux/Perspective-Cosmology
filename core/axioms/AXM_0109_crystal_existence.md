# AXM_0109 Axiom: Crystal Existence (C1)

**Tag**: 0109
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: framework/layer_0_pure_axioms.md (v2.4)
**Added**: Session 72 (formalization)

---

## Requires

- None (primitive)

## Provides

- V_Crystal exists as an inner product space

---

## Statement

**C1 (Existence)**

```
V_Crystal exists as an inner product space over field F.
F = C [DERIVED from AXM_0120: CCP-4 forces F = unique algebraically closed division field].
```

---

## Notes

This is one of the two primitives of the framework:
1. V_Crystal (the perfect crystal space)
2. Perspective (partial access operation)

V_Crystal is the "ground of being" — a perfect, symmetric space with no intrinsic structure. All structure emerges from perspective breaking the symmetry.

## Unification Note (Session 132)

V_Crystal is the SAME space as the value space V in the Universe axioms:
```
V = V_Crystal
dim(V_Crystal) = n_c = 11  [D: from Frobenius-Hurwitz]
```

The basis B_Crystal corresponds to points P via [DEF_02B1: Point-Basis Mapping].

**Field choice**: F = C (complex numbers) — **[DERIVED from AXM_0120 CCP]** (Session S251):
- CCP-4 requires the field to be the maximal algebraically complete division algebra
- Among commutative division algebras {R, C}, only C is algebraically closed (FTA)
- Therefore F = C is FORCED, not chosen. Previous status [RETRODICTION] upgraded.
- See [AXM_0120: Consistency-Completeness Principle] for full derivation
- See [THM_0485: Complex Structure] for the earlier partial derivation from framework axioms
