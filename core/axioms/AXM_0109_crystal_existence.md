# AXM_0109 Axiom: Crystal Existence (C1)

**Tag**: 0109
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: framework/layer_0_pure_axioms.md (v2.4)
**Added**: Session 72 (formalization)

---

## Requires

- None (primitive)

## Provides

- V_Crystal exists as an inner product space

---

## Statement

**C1 (Existence)**

```
V_Crystal exists as an inner product space over field F (where F = R or C).
```

---

## Notes

This is one of the two primitives of the framework:
1. V_Crystal (the perfect crystal space)
2. Perspective (partial access operation)

V_Crystal is the "ground of being" — a perfect, symmetric space with no intrinsic structure. All structure emerges from perspective breaking the symmetry.
