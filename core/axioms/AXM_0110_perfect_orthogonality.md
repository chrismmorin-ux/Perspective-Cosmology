# AXM_0110 Axiom: Perfect Orthogonality (C2)

**Tag**: 0110
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: framework/layer_0_pure_axioms.md (v2.4)
**Added**: Session 72 (formalization)

## Requires

- [AXM_0109: Crystal Existence (C1)]

## Provides

- All basis vectors are perfectly orthogonal

---

## Statement

**C2 (Perfect Orthogonality)**

```
All basis vectors of V_Crystal are perfectly orthogonal:
∀ i ≠ j : ⟨b_i, b_j⟩ = 0
```

---

## Notes

Perfect orthogonality means complete independence of all dimensions. In the Crystal:
- No dimension "knows about" any other
- There is nothing to measure
- There is no preferred direction

This is what makes V_Crystal "perfect" — it has no structure that could distinguish one direction from another.

## Cross-References

- [AXM_0109: Crystal Existence (C1)]
- [DEF_0285: Crystalline] — defines crystalline states as orthogonal
