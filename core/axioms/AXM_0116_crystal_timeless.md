# AXM_0116 Axiom: Crystal is Timeless (T1)

**Tag**: 0116
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: framework/layer_0_pure_axioms.md (v2.4)
**Added**: Session 72 (formalization)

---

## Requires

- [AXM_0109: Crystal Existence (C1)]

## Provides

- V_Crystal has no temporal structure
- Time emerges only through perspective transitions

---

## Statement

**T1 (Crystal is Timeless)**

```
V_Crystal has no temporal structure.
There is no "before" or "after" within the Crystal.
```

---

## Notes

The Crystal itself is eternal and unchanging. Time is NOT a property of V_Crystal but emerges from:

1. **Perspective transitions**: Moving from π₁ to π₂ creates temporal ordering
2. **Information loss**: ΔI ≥ 0 gives time direction (second law)
3. **History**: A sequence of perspectives π₀ → π₁ → ... → π_n

### Block Universe Interpretation

V_Crystal can be thought of as:
- A "block" containing all possible states
- Eternal and complete
- Time emerges as paths through the block

### Relation to Directed Time

- T1 says the Crystal has no time
- T0 says transitions exist in both directions
- Physical time emerges from information constraints (AXM_0107)
- This gives rise to directed, irreversible experienced time

---

## Theorems Derived

- Time direction from information loss (THM_0420: Irreversibility)
- Thermodynamic arrow (THM_0451: Second Law)
