# AXM_0114 Axiom: Tilt Possibility (P4)

**Tag**: 0114
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: framework/layer_0_pure_axioms.md (v2.4)
**Added**: Session 72 (formalization)

## Requires

- [AXM_0109: Crystal Existence (C1)]
- [DEF_0210: Perspective]

## Provides

- Perspectives may introduce non-orthogonal ("tilted") dimensions

---

## Statement

**P4 (Tilt Possibility)**

```
Perspectives may introduce non-zero tilt:
∃ π ∈ Π, ∃ i ≠ j : ε_ij ≠ 0

where ε_ij = ⟨π(b_i), π(b_j)⟩ - δ_ij is the tilt matrix
```

At least some perspectives see dimensions as non-orthogonal.

---

## Notes

The **tilt matrix** ε_ij measures deviation from perfect orthogonality:
- ε_ij = 0 for all i,j: Perspective preserves Crystal's orthogonal structure
- ε_ij ≠ 0 for some i≠j: Perspective distorts the orthogonal structure

**Key Insight**: Tilt is the source of all physics:
- Non-orthogonal dimensions create structure
- Structure enables measurement
- Measurement gives rise to physical quantities

Without tilt (ε = 0), a perspective would see V_Crystal's perfect symmetry — no physics possible.

## Physical Significance

- **Imperfect dimensions**: Our observable dimensions have ε ≠ 0
- **Recrystallization**: Processes that reduce ε toward orthogonality
- **Gravity**: The universal recrystallization process
