# AXM_0105 Axiom: Locality

**Tag**: 0105
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/02_perspective.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0213: Access map A]
- [DEF_0204: Connectivity weights Γ]

## Provides

- Access depends on local path structure

---

## Statement

**A2 (Locality)**

```
A(x) depends only on relation of x to p via Γ-weighted paths
```

What a perspective can access about x is determined by how x
connects to the anchor point through the connectivity structure.

---

## Notes

This axiom ensures access is a local, path-dependent operation.
Information must propagate through the simplicial structure.
