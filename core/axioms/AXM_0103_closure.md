**Tag**: 0103
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/01_universe.md

## Requires

- [DEF_0203: Simplicial complex Σ]

## Provides

- Simplicial closure property

---

## Statement

**U4 (Closure)**

```
∀ σ ∈ Σ, ∀ τ ⊂ σ : τ ∈ Σ
```

Every face of a simplex is also in the complex.

## Notes

This is the standard closure axiom for simplicial complexes.
It ensures Σ is a valid abstract simplicial complex.
