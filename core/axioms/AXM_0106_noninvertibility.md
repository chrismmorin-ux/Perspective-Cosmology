# AXM_0106 Axiom: Non-Invertibility

**Tag**: 0106
**Type**: AXIOM
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/02_perspective.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0213: Access map A]

## Provides

- Access map is not injective

---

## Statement

**A3 (Non-Invertibility)**

```
A is not injective: ∃ x ≠ y with A(x) = A(y)
```

Different global states can appear the same from a perspective.

---

## Notes

This axiom says information is lost in access.
Multiple underlying realities can produce the same appearance.
This is related to holographic principles and measurement limits.
