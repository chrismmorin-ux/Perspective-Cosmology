## The Problem

Global entropy increases. Yet locally, ordered structures persist (stars, organisms, civilizations). How?

---

## Eddy Defined

An **entropy eddy** E ⊂ U is a region where:

```
1. LOCAL ENTROPY DECREASE
   ∃ adjacency chains in E where S(πᵢ₊₁) < S(πᵢ)

2. BOUNDARY ENTROPY EXPORT
   At ∂E: S(π_out) > S(π_in)

3. NET GLOBAL INCREASE
   Total entropy (E + surroundings) still increases
```

**Intuition**: Whirlpools in the entropy river. Locally flow backward; globally river still flows to sea.

## Mechanisms of Local Order

**1. Dimensional Realization**
```
Eddies access latent dimensions not available elsewhere.
New distinctions become possible locally.
Effective dimensionality increases.
```

**2. Information Concentration**
```
Eddies gather/compress information from surroundings.
Low entropy = concentrated information.
Requires energy/work to maintain.
```

**3. Boundary Management**
```
- Import low-entropy resources
- Export high-entropy waste
- Maintain internal coherence
```

**4. Self-Repair**
```
Feedback loops resist entropy increase.
Restore coherence after perturbation.
```

## Life as Eddy

A **living system** L is an eddy with:

```
1. METABOLISM
   Continuous low-S import, high-S export.
   ∂L is actively managed.

2. REPRODUCTION
   L can nucleate new eddies L' with similar structure.

3. ADAPTATION
   L modifies structure in response to environment.

4. COHERENT TRAJECTORY
   Underlying γ_L maintains identity (Coh ≥ ξ).
```

**Lifespan**: Life exists while eddy persists. Death = dissolution.

## Intelligence as Deep Eddy

Intelligent system = eddy that:
```
- Models its own eddy structure
- Predicts entropy flows
- Optimizes boundary management
- Has recursive self-reference
```

---

## Theorem E.1 (Eddy Existence)

```
Local entropy decrease is possible iff
balanced by boundary entropy export.

Total entropy still increases.
```

## Open Questions

- [ ] Minimum energy for eddy maintenance
- [ ] Maximum lifetime of an eddy
- [ ] Can eddies nest indefinitely?
