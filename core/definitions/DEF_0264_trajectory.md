# DEF_0264 Definition: Trajectory

**Tag**: 0264
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/09_trajectory.md

## Requires

- [DEF_0202: Points P]
- [DEF_0203: Simplicial complex Σ]

## Provides

- γ: Trajectory (world-line in U)

---

## Statement

A **trajectory** is a connected subset of P:

```
γ ⊂ P

such that ∀ x, y ∈ γ : ∃ path in γ via Σ₁
```

Trajectories are "world-lines" embedded in U's structure.

## Notes

Not to be confused with the overlap parameter γ (same symbol, different context).
