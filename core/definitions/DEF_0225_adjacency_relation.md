## Requires

- [DEF_0210: Perspective π]
- [DEF_0214: Accessible content U_π]

## Provides

- ~: Adjacency relation between perspectives

---

## Statement

Two perspectives π₁, π₂ are **adjacent** if:

```
π₁ ~ π₂  ⟺  U_{π₁} ∩ U_{π₂} ≠ ∅
```

They share some accessible content.

## Notes

Adjacency defines which perspectives can "communicate" or transition.
Forms the basis for the directed graph structure on Π.
