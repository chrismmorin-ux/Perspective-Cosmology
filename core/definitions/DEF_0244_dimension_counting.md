# DEF_0244 Definition: Dimension Counting

**Tag**: 0244
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/06_basis_geometry.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0242: Subspace decomposition]

## Provides

- n_i: Dimension of each subspace

---

## Statement

```
n_i = |B_i| = dim(V_i)
Σ_i n_i = n = dim(V)
```

The dimensions of subspaces sum to the total dimension.

---

## Notes

Dimension counting is fundamental to structure analysis.
