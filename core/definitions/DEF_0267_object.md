# DEF_0267 Definition: Object

**Tag**: 0267
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/09_trajectory.md

## Requires

- [DEF_0264: Trajectory]
- [DEF_0266: Coherent trajectory]

## Provides

- O: Object as coherent trajectory-slice equivalence class

---

## Statement

An **object** O is an equivalence class of trajectory-slices:

```
O = { A_π(γ ∩ U_π) | π ∈ T, Coh(γ, πᵢ, πᵢ₊₁) ≥ ξ ∀ i }
```

Objects don't move through time. Perspectives move through Π; coherent trajectories appear as persistent objects.

---

## Notes

This is a relational definition of objecthood:
objects are patterns that persist across perspective transitions.
