# DEF_0232 Definition: Overlap Regimes

**Tag**: 0232
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/05_overlap.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0230: Overlap parameter γ]

## Provides

- Classification of high-γ, low-γ, intermediate regimes

---

## Statement

**High-γ Regime** (γ → 1)
```
Perspectives nearly coincide.
Transitions preserve most information.
```

**Low-γ Regime** (γ → 0)
```
Perspectives barely overlap.
Transitions change most accessible content.
```

**Intermediate-γ Regime**
```
Partial overlap.
Neither limit dominates.
```

---

## Notes

These regimes correspond to different physical limits:
- High-γ: quantum regime (conjectured)
- Low-γ: gravitational regime (conjectured)
See physics/conjectures/ for mapping to physics.
