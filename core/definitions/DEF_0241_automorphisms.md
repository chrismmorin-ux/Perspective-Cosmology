# DEF_0241 Definition: Automorphisms of B

**Tag**: 0241
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/06_basis_geometry.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0240: B-structure]

## Provides

- Aut(B): Automorphism group of basis

---

## Statement

**Aut(B)**: Transformations preserving B-structure

```
Aut(B) = { T ∈ GL(V) : T(B) = B as a set }
```

For orthonormal B: Aut(B) ⊆ O(n).

---

## Notes

Automorphisms are symmetries that preserve the basis structure.
For orthonormal bases, these are subgroups of the orthogonal group.
