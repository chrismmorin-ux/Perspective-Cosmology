# DEF_0271 Definition: Measure on Π

**Tag**: 0271
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/11_perspective_space.md

## Requires

- [DEF_0216: Perspective space Π]

## Provides

- ν: Measure on perspective space

---

## Statement

**Counting Measure** (finite Π):
```
ν(S) = |S|  for S ⊆ Π
```

**Uniform Measure** (continuous approximation):
```
ν = normalized Lebesgue measure
ν(Π) = 1
```

**Integration**:
```
⟨f⟩_Π = (1/|Π|) Σ_{π ∈ Π} f(π)
```

---

## Notes

The measure enables averaging over all perspectives.
