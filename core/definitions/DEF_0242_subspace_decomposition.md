# DEF_0242 Definition: Subspace Decomposition

**Tag**: 0242
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/06_basis_geometry.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0240: B-structure]

## Provides

- Decomposition of B into orthogonal subspaces

---

## Statement

B may decompose into subspaces:

```
B = B_1 ⊔ B_2 ⊔ ... ⊔ B_k  (disjoint union)

V = V_1 ⊕ V_2 ⊕ ... ⊕ V_k  (orthogonal sum)

where V_i = span(B_i)
```

---

## Notes

This decomposition is the mathematical basis for gauge structure.
Each subspace may correspond to different physical sectors.
