# DEF_0233 Definition: Global Overlap

**Tag**: 0233
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/05_overlap.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0230: Overlap parameter γ]
- [DEF_0216: Perspective space Π]

## Provides

- γ_global: Average overlap over universe

---

## Statement

**Local γ**: Between adjacent perspectives (DEF_0230)

**Global γ**: Average over all perspective pairs

```
γ_global = (1/|pairs|) Σ_{π₁~π₂} γ(π₁, π₂)
```

Characterizes the "overlap density" of U.

## Notes

Global overlap is a property of the entire universe structure.
It may relate to physical constants (see physics/conjectures/).
