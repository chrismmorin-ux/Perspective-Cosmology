# DEF_0260 Definition: Temporal Sequence

**Tag**: 0260
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/08_time.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0216: Perspective space Π]
- [DEF_0225: Adjacency relation ~]
- [AXM_0107: Non-negative loss]

## Provides

- T: Temporal sequence through Π

---

## Statement

A **temporal sequence** is a directed path through Π:

```
T = (π₀ → π₁ → π₂ → ... → πₙ)

where each πᵢ → πᵢ₊₁ is valid directed adjacency
```

---

## Notes

**Key Insight:**
```
Time is not a dimension of U.
Time is a directed path through Π.
```
