# DEF_0286 Definition: Perspectival Defect

**Tag**: 0286
**Type**: DEFINITION
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: core/13_crystallinity.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0272: Perspectival variance]
- [DEF_0285: Crystalline]

## Provides

- Defect in crystalline structure

---

## Statement

A **defect** is a region R ⊂ U where:

```
Var(R) > 0  while  Var(U \ R) ≈ 0
```

Defects break the symmetry that makes crystals "dead."

---

## Notes

```
Experience requires Var > 0.
Crystalline structure is experientially inert.
Defects enable distinction, change, time.
```
