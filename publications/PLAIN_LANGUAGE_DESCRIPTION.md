## What It Is

Perspective Cosmology is an amateur, speculative theoretical framework — built by a non-professional with AI assistance — that asks one radical question:

**What if the laws of physics aren't arbitrary? What if they're the only mathematically possible outcome of observation itself existing?**

The framework tries to show that if you start from the bare minimum requirements for *anything to be observed at all*, you get forced — step by step — into the exact physics we see: the Standard Model of particle physics, Einstein's general relativity, 3+1 spacetime dimensions, and even specific numerical values of constants like the fine structure constant.

It is **not** established physics. It has not been peer-reviewed. The framework's own adversarial review estimates a 25-40% chance that it's genuinely capturing real physics rather than being an elaborate coincidence (Red Team v3.0, S330). But the results are unusual enough that the author considers them worth investigating.

---

## The Starting Point: What Does Observation Require?

The framework doesn't start with particles, fields, or spacetime. It starts with something more primitive: **what must be true for anything to be distinguishable from anything else?**

Four requirements:

1. **Partiality** — An observer can't see everything. If you could access all of reality at once, there's no "you" separate from reality.

2. **Non-triviality** — An observer must see *something*. A viewpoint that accesses nothing isn't a viewpoint at all.

3. **Distinguishability** — Different things must actually look different. If all states are identical from your viewpoint, there's no information.

4. **Consistency** — Observations must compose without contradiction. If you observe A, then observe B, then observe A again, the results need to be compatible.

That fourth requirement — consistency — turns out to be enormously constraining.

---

## The Mathematical Bottleneck: Division Algebras

Consistency demands that the algebra governing transitions between observational states has no "zero divisors." In plain terms: no two non-zero observations can combine to give nothing.

A mathematician named Frobenius proved in 1877, and Hurwitz extended in 1898, that the *only* number systems satisfying this requirement (over the real numbers, with finite dimensions) are exactly four:

| Number System | Dimension | Everyday Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| **Real numbers** (R) | 1 | The number line |
| **Complex numbers** (C) | 2 | Points on a plane |
| **Quaternions** (H) | 4 | Rotations in 3D space |
| **Octonions** (O) | 8 | An exotic 8-dimensional algebra |

That's it. There are no others. This isn't a choice or an assumption — it's a proven mathematical theorem. The framework claims that these four algebras, with dimensions {1, 2, 4, 8}, are the DNA of physics.

---

## From Algebra to Spacetime

**Why is spacetime 4-dimensional?** Because time evolution must be *associative* — meaning it doesn't matter how you group sequential events: (A then B) then C must equal A then (B then C). The largest division algebra that's associative is the quaternions, which have 4 dimensions. So spacetime has 4 dimensions (3 space + 1 time).

The octonions (dimension 8) are *not* associative. The framework interprets this as the reason the octonions describe *internal* symmetries (the forces) rather than spacetime.

---

## From Algebra to Forces

The Standard Model of particle physics has three forces, described by the gauge group U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3). These correspond to electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force.

The framework claims each force comes from the *symmetry group* of one of the division algebras:

- **Electromagnetism** (U(1)) from the symmetries of the **complex numbers**
- **Weak force** (SU(2)) from the symmetries of the **quaternions**
- **Strong force** (SU(3)) from the symmetries of the **octonions**

This connection between division algebras and gauge groups is explored by several professional physicists (notably Furey, Dixon, and others). What's distinctive here is pushing it further to derive numerical constants.

---

## From Algebra to Quantum Mechanics

One of the framework's strongest results: quantum mechanics — the mathematical formalism governing the subatomic world — is **derived** from the perspective axioms. The key elements:

- **Hilbert space** (the mathematical arena where quantum states live) emerges from the Crystal's inner product structure
- **Unitary evolution** (the Schrodinger equation) follows from information conservation
- **The Born rule** (probability = |amplitude|^2) follows from the symmetry of overlapping perspectives

This derivation received the framework's highest grade (A) and is classified as CANONICAL — meaning it's rigorous enough to reference as established within the framework.

---

## The Numerical Predictions

This is where the framework is most striking and most controversial. Using only the numbers {1, 2, 4, 8} and their algebraic combinations, it produces formulas for fundamental constants:

**The fine structure constant** (which governs the strength of electromagnetism):
- Formula: 1/alpha = 137 + 4/111 = 15211/111
- This gives 137.036036...
- The measured value is 137.035999177 (CODATA 2022)
- That's a match to **0.27 parts per million** at tree level — using only integers
- With a two-loop correction (C_2 = 24/11, [DERIVATION]), this improves to 0.001 ppm (5.9 sigma). With a three-loop correction (D_3 = 1, [CONJECTURE]): **0.0006 sigma** from measurement

**The proton-to-electron mass ratio** (why the proton is ~1836 times heavier than the electron):
- Formula: m_p/m_e = 1836 + 11/72
- This gives 1836.15278
- Measured: 1836.15267
- Match to **0.06 parts per million**

**The Weinberg angle** (which determines the relative strengths of electromagnetic and weak forces):
- Formula: cos(theta_W) = 171/194
- Match to **3.75 parts per million**

Beyond these headline results, the framework produces predictions for dozens of other quantities: the Hubble constant (H_0 = 337/5 = 67.4, which matches the CMB measurement exactly), cosmological density parameters, CMB observables, and more.

In total: 12 predictions match to better than 10 parts per million, though 3 of these have significant caveats.

---

## The Honest Concerns

1. **It could be numerology.** A rigorous statistical test showed that any 7 small integers can match most physics constants to 1% by chance. The framework's building blocks are NOT special at percent-level precision. The sub-parts-per-million matches are much harder to dismiss, but percent-level matches are individually meaningless.

2. **Post-hoc fitting.** Most of the impressive formulas were found *after* the measured values were known. It's very difficult to prove that a formula was *derived* from principles rather than *discovered* by searching. The framework calls this "the derivation vs. discovery problem."

3. **Amateur work.** The author is not a professional physicist. While this doesn't automatically invalidate the work, it means the derivation chains may have gaps.

4. **4 irreducible assumptions.** Earlier claims of "zero free parameters" have been corrected. The framework makes 4 assumptions that aren't forced by the axioms alone (1 structural, 2 physical, 1 import — reduced from ~10 via resolution campaign S258-S304). See `framework/IRREDUCIBLE_ASSUMPTIONS.md`.

5. **Incomplete derivation chains.** Some key steps — particularly "Step 5" of the fine structure constant derivation — remain at the conjecture level.

6. **~~Cosmological constant has wrong sign.~~** **RESOLVED (S230)**: This was a sign convention error in the framework documents. The correct GR relationship (Λ = -8πG·V) gives the right sign. The *magnitude* gap (~10^111) remains — this is the standard CC problem shared by all physics frameworks.

7. **Internal probability estimate: 25-40%.** The framework's own adversarial analysis (Red Team v3.0, S330) gives it roughly one-in-three odds of being genuine physics.

## What the Framework Gets Right (Potentially)

- Derives the correct gauge groups of the Standard Model from pure algebra
- Produces 3+1 spacetime dimensions from associativity
- Gets 15 fermions per generation from division algebra representation theory
- **Derives quantum mechanics from observation axioms** (strongest result)
- Produces sub-parts-per-million matches for several fundamental constants using only integers
- Provides a unified picture spanning particle physics, cosmology, and CMB from the same handful of numbers
- 9 "blind" predictions (made before checking measurements) — 8 of 9 within 1 sigma

---

## Testable Predictions

| Prediction | Value | When We'll Know |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Dark matter particle mass | 5.11 GeV | SuperCDMS 2026-2027 |
| No 95 GeV scalar particle | Absent | LHC Run 3 data |
| Tensor-to-scalar ratio | r = 0.035 | CMB-S4 ~2028 |
| Neutrino mass ordering | Normal, lightest = 0 | JUNO ~2027 |
| Higgs coupling modification | 1.7% below Standard Model | FCC-ee (future) |

If these predictions fail, the framework is wrong and we'll document why. If they succeed, it becomes much harder to dismiss as coincidence.

---

## The Bottom Line

Perspective Cosmology is a speculative framework that says: the structure of physics is what you get when you ask "what's the minimum math needed for observation to exist?" It uses four number systems (the division algebras) as its only building blocks and claims to derive an impressively wide range of physics from them.

It has produced some striking numerical coincidences, a rigorous derivation of quantum mechanics, and qualitative derivations of the Standard Model's structure. It also has clear failures (CC magnitude gap, 14 falsified claims including 1 resolved) and clear falsification criteria.

Whether this is a genuine insight into the structure of reality or an elaborate pattern-matching exercise remains genuinely unknown. The author maintains epistemic humility about this, documents failures alongside successes, and explicitly invites skeptical scrutiny.
