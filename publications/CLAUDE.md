# Publications Directory

Draft publications and honest self-assessments for external audiences.

## Entry Point

**`HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md`** — The most important file. Frank evaluation of what the framework achieves and where it falls short.

## Key Files

| File | Audience | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md` | Everyone | Candid self-evaluation |
| `TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md` | Physicists | Technical overview |
| `THESIS.md` | Academic | Draft thesis document |
| `OBJECTIONS_AND_RESPONSES.md` | Skeptics | Anticipated criticisms and responses |

## Tone

All publications use measured, honest language. Never overclaim. Default to epistemic humility. This is speculative amateur work — acknowledge that directly.
