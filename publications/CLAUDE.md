All publications use measured, honest language. Never overclaim. Default to epistemic humility. This is speculative amateur work — acknowledge that directly.

## Standards

- Every document uses the `TEMPLATE.md` format
- Every document lists its key file references
- Every document identifies critical theorems/conjectures it depends on
- Every document has a revision history
- Footer: `*Status: Speculative theoretical framework. Not peer-reviewed. Amateur work with AI assistance.*`
