## Top 5 Scoring Justifications

### Rank 1: Om_m = 63/200 mechanism (Score 13.3)

- **D = 8**: 63/200 feeds into Omega_Lambda (= 137/200), r_s via standard integrals (0.03%), CMB peak positions, BAO predictions, BBN yields. One of 4 EXACT Tier 1 claims. Without mechanism: [CONJECTURE] with HRS~5. **S248 (CNH)**: 63 = non-norm (inert prime 7), 200 = norm. Classification: matter=non-crystalline, dark energy=crystalline. CNH provides why-classification but NOT mechanism.
- **G = 4**: No physical mechanism despite algebraic decompositions (63 = O^2-1, 200 = O*(R+H)^2). All S94-S126 attempts failed.
- **F = 3**: Derived mechanism enables blind predictions for BAO, cluster counts, other cosmological observables.
- **E = 3**: Extensive prior work. New approaches needed -- crystallization dynamics or dark sector structure.

### Rank 2: Alpha Step 5 mechanism (Score 10.7)

- **D = 8**: 1/alpha = 137 + 4/111 is the flagship prediction (0.27 ppm). Steps 1-4 graded B+ to A. Step 5 (why 1/N_I = 1/137 is EM coupling) is grade D+/C-. **S258**: CONJ-A3 PROVEN (independence forced by Radon-Hurwitz), reducing gap to gauge kinetic term normalization only.
- **G = 4**: Six mechanisms explored (5A-5F), none fully derived. Coset geometry ONLY remaining path.
- **F = 2**: Internal consistency check (not new blind prediction).
- **E = 3**: Remaining gap is specific but all easy paths exhausted.

### Rank 4: Alpha C=24/11 radiative correction (Score 9.0) — RESCORED S279

- **D = 6**: S266 tree->dressed paradigm applies to ALL 12 framework predictions. Three cleanly separated bands matching QFT loop hierarchy. C=24/11 gives 0.0002 ppm residual (99x better than C=2). Correction methodology now general: affects alpha, Weinberg, mass ratios.
- **G = 4**: (was 5) Numerator N_colored=24 DERIVED (S269). Weinberg coefficient=n_d=dim(H) structurally motivated from Hom(R^4,R^7) (S279). Product formula C=sum(Q^2)*rho_EM remains [CONJECTURE]. Band B coefficients (1/n_d, 1/n_c) at [SPECULATION] with HRS 5. Status: [CONJECTURE] (multiple structural routes, none fully derived).
- **F = 2**: Constrains correction structure (but same observable).
- **E = 2**: Clear next step: derive product formula from democratic metric, or predict three-loop coefficient. 27/27 PASS (alpha), 30/37 PASS (Weinberg).

### Rank 4: Vacuum polarization from tilt (Score 9.3)

- **D = 7**: All 3 SM beta coefficients decompose into framework numbers (S207). Pattern-matching currently; needs first-principles calculation. If derived, would validate QFT loop structure from crystallization dynamics.
- **G = 4**: Pure [CONJECTURE]. No derivation attempted.
- **F = 2**: Would constrain running coupling predictions.
- **E = 3**: Requires connecting tilt Lagrangian to vacuum polarization diagrams.

### Rank 5: V0 inflationary amplitude (Score 8.0)

- **D = 6**: Sets amplitude of density fluctuations. 6 downstream CMB/LSS observables. **UNBLOCKED**: EQ-020 (mass scale f) resolved S233.
- **G = 4**: All 4 prior paths failed (S191). No clear path forward.
- **F = 3**: V0/M_Pl^4 ~ 1.3e-9 is blind prediction target.
- **E = 4**: High effort. May need SO(11) breaking energy scales or entirely new approach.
