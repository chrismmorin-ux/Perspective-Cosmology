## Top 5 Scoring Justifications

### Rank 1: Herm(2) = spacetime (Score 14.4)

- **D = 9**: Weakest link in the eval map chain (S200). If Herm(2) cannot be connected to spacetime via spectral geometry, the entire geometric pipeline from perspectives to 3+1 dimensions has a gap. Downstream: spacetime dimension, Lorentz signature (THM_04AE), Einstein equations, all gravity-dependent predictions.
- **G = 4**: Currently [A-PHYSICAL] -- the weakest tag in an otherwise strong chain (gauge chain is [DERIVATION], QM chain is [CANONICAL]). This is effectively [CONJECTURE] level.
- **F = 2**: Success would constrain the spacetime signature and metric. Not a blind prediction (3+1 is known), but derives a known fact from framework axioms.
- **E = 2**: Connes spectral triple machinery is well-developed in literature. The specific application to M_2(C) is a focused calculation, not open-ended research.

### Rank 2: Om_m = 63/200 mechanism (Score 13.3)

- **D = 8**: 63/200 feeds into Omega_Lambda (= 137/200), r_s via standard integrals (0.03%), CMB peak positions, BAO predictions, BBN yields. It is one of 4 EXACT Tier 1 claims (H0, Om_Lambda, Om_m, l_1). Without a mechanism, it remains [CONJECTURE] with HRS~5.
- **G = 4**: Algebraic decompositions exist (63 = O^2-1, 200 = O*(R+H)^2), but no physical mechanism. All S94-S126 attempts documented, none succeeded. Pure [CONJECTURE].
- **F = 3**: A derived mechanism would enable blind predictions for BAO at different redshifts, cluster counts, and other cosmological observables not yet tested.
- **E = 3**: Extensive prior work (S94-S126) documented in cmb-physics topic file. New approaches needed -- likely requires connecting to SO(11) Goldstone thermalization or dark sector structure.

### Rank 3: Fermion embedding MCHM4 vs MCHM5 (Score 11.2) — NEW

- **D = 7**: S210 open question. Determines kappa_f (5.03% below SM in MCHM5). Blocks: top Yukawa derivation, Higgs mass chain (lambda_H = 125/968), HL-LHC coupling interpretation. If MCHM4, kappa_f = kappa_V = 0.983 (HL-LHC indistinguishable from SM); if MCHM5, kappa_f = 0.950 (testable at HL-LHC).
- **G = 4**: Currently [CONJECTURE] — SO(11) representation theory approach needed. Partial compositeness calculation not yet attempted.
- **F = 2**: Constrains Higgs coupling deviations and fermion Yukawa structure. HL-LHC decision point.
- **E = 3**: Requires SO(11)→SM representation decomposition, partial compositeness calculation, and Yukawa structure from eval map.

### Rank 4: Alpha Step 5 mechanism (Score 10.7)

- **D = 8**: 1/alpha = 137 + 4/111 is the flagship prediction (0.27 ppm). Steps 1-4 are graded B+ to A. Step 5 (why 1/N_I = 1/137 is the EM coupling) is grade D+/C-. Without it, alpha is "right number, possibly wrong reason." Downstream: Higgs VEV, electroweak masses, cosmological constant.
- **G = 4**: Six mechanisms explored (5A-5F), none fully derived. S211: critical equipartition RULED OUT (SO(11) transition is first-order). Coset geometry ONLY remaining path. Gap G2 (uniformity) is CLOSED (S165), but gauge kinetic term normalization remains open.
- **F = 2**: Would constrain the coupling mechanism and possibly predict corrections or running behavior. Internal consistency check rather than new blind prediction.
- **E = 3**: Extensive prior work (9 sessions). Remaining gap is specific (gauge kinetic term normalization), but all easy paths have been tried.

### Rank 4: CC wrong sign F-10 (Score 9.3)

- **D = 7**: The cosmological constant is a major prediction (Omega_Lambda = 137/200, Tier 1 EXACT). F-10 (wrong sign from crystallization_stress_cosmology.md) means the proposed mechanism is broken, even though the numerical value works. Downstream: dark energy equation of state, late-time cosmology, w = -1 prediction.
- **G = 4**: The mechanism is [FALSIFIED], not just gap-level. The VALUE still works but the REASON is wrong. This is worse than [CONJECTURE] -- it is an active contradiction.
- **F = 2**: Resolution would either fix the dark energy mechanism (constraining w) or declare dark energy out of scope (which itself is informative).
- **E = 3**: S156 and S199 explored multiple paths. CC is notoriously difficult. May require fundamentally new approach or honest declaration that the framework does not address dark energy dynamics.

### Rank 5: V0 inflationary amplitude (Score 8.0)

- **D = 6**: V0 sets the overall amplitude of density fluctuations (delta_T/T, sigma_8, power spectrum normalization). Without it, the framework can predict spectral shape (n_s, r) but not amplitude. 6 downstream CMB/LSS observables depend on it.
- **G = 4**: All 4 prior derivation paths failed (S191: democratic, tilt potential, expression search, mode counting). Currently [CONJECTURE] with no clear path forward.
- **F = 3**: V0/M_Pl^4 ~ 1.3e-9 is a blind prediction target. A derived expression would yield sigma_8, delta_T/T, and other amplitude-dependent observables as blind predictions.
- **E = 4**: All straightforward paths exhausted. Likely requires connecting to SO(11) breaking energy scales or finding a new approach entirely. High effort.

## Suggested Session Allocation

### Immediate (Next 2 sessions): Quick Wins + S210 Follow-up
- **Fermion embedding** (MCHM4 vs MCHM5): 1 session -- blocks kappa_f, top Yukawa, Higgs mass. S210 flagged as direct next step.
- **Cyclotomic 43 pattern**: 1 session -- high novelty, low effort. Rapid check if Phi_6(7)=43 pattern is structural vs artifact.

### Near-term (Next 3-5 sessions): Highest Impact
- **Herm(2) spectral geometry**: 2 sessions -- apply Connes framework to M_2(C). Highest downstream impact.
- **QCD lattice check**: 1 session -- blind prediction ready, direct falsification, potential Tier 1 upgrade.
- **Alpha Step 5 coset geometry**: 1-2 sessions -- equipartition ruled out, only path remaining.

### Mid-term: Focused Derivations
- Om_m = 63/200 mechanism (2-3 sessions, needs new methodology)
- CC sign resolution or archival (1 session)

### Longer-term: Large Projects
- V0 inflationary amplitude (3-4 sessions, may need new ideas)
- Dark matter 5 GeV mechanism (3 sessions)
- LLM Derivation Challenge (5 sessions, mostly external coordination)
