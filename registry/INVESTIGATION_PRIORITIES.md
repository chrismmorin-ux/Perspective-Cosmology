## Top 5 Scoring Justifications

### Rank 1: Colored pNGB mass (Score 15.0) -- NEW at #1

- **D = 5**: Critical for HL-LHC predictions. Connects to top Yukawa (now resolved), Higgs branching (kappa_lambda), and direct scalar search. Crude 151 GeV < LHC exclusion; enhanced ~590 GeV; multi-site ~1.7 TeV.
- **G = 4**: No principled CW calculation done. Only order-of-magnitude estimates.
- **F = 3**: Direct HL-LHC blind prediction. Framework says pNGBs exist -- mass sets discovery potential.
- **E = 2**: Clear path: CW calculation with specific SO(11)/SO(4)xSO(7) composite sector. y_t=1 now available.

### Rank 2: V0 inflationary amplitude (Score 14.0)

- **D = 7**: Sets amplitude of density fluctuations. 7 downstream CMB/LSS observables.
- **G = 4**: V_0=alpha^4/C candidate (0.29 sigma, HRS 5). Found by search, not derived.
- **F = 3**: V0/M_Pl^4 ~ 1.3e-9 is blind prediction target.
- **E = 3**: High effort. All 4 prior paths failed. Same C=24/11 as alpha correction -- structural link.

### Rank 3: Cyclotomic 43 pattern (Score 10.0)

- **D = 5**: Two Tier 1 claims share Phi_6(Im_O)=43 denominator (m_p/m_e, m_mu/m_e).
- **G = 2**: Sign DERIVED (S240). Magnitude structural. Essentially complete.
- **F = 2**: Constrains correction structure.
- **E = 1**: Near-complete. One session to finalize Frobenius constraint.

### Rank 4: Dark matter mass (Score 9.0)

- **D = 6**: Three formulas found. A/C agree 0.03% (m_p x 49/9 = 5.11 GeV). Discovery potential.
- **G = 4**: None derived from first principles. Selection mechanism unknown.
- **F = 3**: Direct detection blind prediction at ~5 GeV.
- **E = 4**: Needs formula selection mechanism or experimental constraint.

### Rank 5: c3 > 0 selection (Score 8.0)

- **D = 4**: c3>0 selects (4,7) breaking. Feeds into gauge group, Higgs potential, EW sector.
- **G = 4**: Global minimum gives (2,9) for both signs. Dynamical curvature gives (4,7) when c3>0.
- **F = 2**: Internal consistency (affects breaking pattern).
- **E = 2**: May connect to IRA-04 (rho=c_4/b_4=11/3 candidate).

### Mid-term: Major Derivations
- V0 inflationary amplitude (EQ-011): 2-3 sessions, HRS 5 candidate needs mechanism
- Dark matter formula selection (EQ-013): 2-3 sessions
- Black hole entropy (EQ-017): 2 sessions, create investigation file

### Longer-term: Monitoring
- Primordial GW r = 0.035 (EQ-032): CMB-S4 ~2028
