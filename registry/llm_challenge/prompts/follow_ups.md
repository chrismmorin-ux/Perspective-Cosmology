# Follow-Up Prompts

Use these if the model asks for clarification instead of proceeding with a derivation.

## Standard Follow-Up (Variant 1)

If the model asks questions instead of answering, paste this:

```
Work with what's given. The axioms should be sufficient.

If you need to recall a theorem (like Frobenius or Hurwitz), please state it from memory and apply it. The key constraint is that the transition algebra must be a finite-dimensional division algebra over R, and time evolution requires associativity.

Please proceed with your derivation.
```
