# Active Sessions

Sessions register here at start, deregister at end.

**Stale threshold**: Entries older than 24 hours without updates are STALE — ignore or clean up.

**Protocol**:
- **Session start**: Add a row to "Currently Active" with session label, focus, date
- **Session end**: Move row to "Recently Completed" with handoff notes
- **Stale cleanup**: Any new session may remove entries >24h old from "Currently Active"
