# Active Sessions

Sessions register here at start, deregister at end.

**Stale threshold**: Entries older than 24 hours without updates are STALE — ignore or clean up.
**Recently Completed**: Last 5 only. Older entries archived to `archive/sessions/completed_sessions_log.md`.

**Protocol**:
- **Session start**: Add a row to "Currently Active" with session label, focus, date
- **Session end**: Move row to "Recently Completed" with handoff notes (keep last 5 only)
- **Stale cleanup**: Any new session may remove entries >24h old from "Currently Active"

## Recently Completed (last 5)

| Session | Focus | Completed | Handoff Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| S372 | DM carrier identity (nu_R) + vacuum stability scoping | 2026-02-10 | CONDITIONAL: nu_R is unique candidate but stability/neutrino-mass tension is 10.7 OOM (fatal without +1 assumption). Resolution A (decoupled 1st gen, IRA 4->5) most economical. Vacuum stability (EQ-033) scoped: all inputs ready, next physics session. 14/14 PASS. |
| S371 | Public materials consistency/accuracy audit | 2026-02-09 | 8 CRITICAL + ~15 MAJOR issues fixed across 20+ files. Tree/dressed presentation fixed on homepage + all entry-point docs. Coset, Aut(C), ghost axiom, section numbering, script counts all fixed. Remaining: 3 broken links, 5 placeholder pages, accessibility. |
| S370 | Launch audit + W11 + O6 publish | 2026-02-09 | W11 COMPLETE: /explore/perspective (tower cascade, Im_C properties, epistemic boundary). 20 KB (5.5 KB gzip). O6 PUBLISHED: final pass, F-6 fix, closing links. C5 status updated. Launch audit: 22/32 done, 10 remaining. |
| S369 | Launch C5c: PLAIN_LANGUAGE + QUICKSTART v3.0 | 2026-02-09 | Both v3.0 COMPLETE. PLD: +4 new sections (YM, generations, cosmology/DM, tree-to-dressed), phase grades, full pub list. QS: +phase grades, Physicist Summary, colored pNGB. |
| S368 | Launch C5b: TECHNICAL_SUMMARY + OBJECTIONS v3.0 | 2026-02-09 | Both v3.0 COMPLETE. DM section added, 3 new objections, phase grades updated. |
