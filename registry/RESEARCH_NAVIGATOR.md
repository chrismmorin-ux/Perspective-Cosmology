# Research Navigator

**Updated**: 2026-01-28 (Session 118 — Strategic Reorganization)
**Purpose**: Guide research aligned with MASTER_PLAN.md
**Central Document**: `publications/THESIS.md` — The framework's central claim

---

## Strategic Framework

All work now organized around the central thesis:

> **Physics is the unique mathematical structure compatible with observation itself.**

Four pillars guide all research:

| Pillar | Goal | Priority |
|--------|------|----------|
| **1. Foundation** | Make inevitability argument airtight | HIGHEST |
| **2. Numerical** | Strengthen predictions, find more sub-ppm | HIGH |
| **3. Experimental** | Prepare for decisive tests | HIGH |
| **4. Communication** | Present to physics community | MEDIUM |

## Current Phase: Foundation Consolidation (Phase 1)

**Sessions 119-125 Target**

### Priority 1: The Inevitability Argument

| Task | Status | File |
|------|--------|------|
| Observation → no zero-divisors | STUB | `foundations/observation_consistency.md` |
| Frobenius necessity | STUB | `foundations/frobenius_necessity.md` |
| {1,2,4,8} uniqueness | STUB | `foundations/division_algebra_uniqueness.md` |
| n_d = 4 from associativity | PARTIAL | Strengthen existing |
| Gauge from Aut(C×H×O) | PARTIAL | Strengthen existing |

**Success criterion**: Zero logical gaps from "observation exists" to "SM gauge group"

### Priority 2: Layer Architecture Cleanup

| Layer | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0 (pure axioms) | NEEDS AUDIT | Remove any physics concepts |
| 1 (math consequences) | GOOD | Verify follows from Layer 0 |
| 2 (correspondence) | NEEDS WORK | Make ALL imports explicit |
| 3 (predictions) | GOOD | Document derivation chains |

### Priority 3: Derivation Chain Verification

| Chain | Status | Gap |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Axioms → n_d = 4 | COMPLETE | — |
| Axioms → n_c = 11 | COMPLETE | — |
| n_d, n_c → 137 | COMPLETE | — |
| 137 → 1/α formula | PARTIAL | Why 4/111 correction? |
| Axioms → Einstein equations | SKETCH | Crystallization → metric |

## Active Predictions (Pillar 3)

### Decisive Test: Dark Matter

| Property | Prediction | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Mass | 5.11 GeV (range 4.5-5.7) | ACTIVE |
| Timeline | SuperCDMS 2026, LZ ongoing | TESTING NOW |
| Falsification | Mass outside range | CLEAR |

**Package**: `predictions/dark_matter_5gev.md`

### Observed Confirmation: Hubble Tension

| Property | Prediction | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| CMB H₀ | 337/5 = 67.4 | **EXACT** |
| Local H₀ | 67.4 × 13/12 = 72.9 | 0.14% error |
| Ratio | 13/12 = 1.0833 | MATCHES |

**Package**: `predictions/hubble_tension.md` (TODO)

## Next Session Checklist

### Start
1. Read `MASTER_PLAN.md` — Current phase
2. Read this file — Current priorities
3. Brief user on phase progress

### During
For every piece of work, ask:
- Does this strengthen the inevitability argument? (Pillar 1)
- Does this improve a numerical prediction? (Pillar 2)
- Does this prepare for experimental contact? (Pillar 3)
- Does this help communicate to physicists? (Pillar 4)

### End
1. Update task status in `MASTER_PLAN.md`
2. Update `STATUS_DASHBOARD.md` metrics
3. Log session in `session_log.md`

## The Vision

If the inevitability argument is airtight:
- Physics is mathematically necessary
- Constants are calculable
- No multiverse needed
- We understand why

If the dark matter prediction is confirmed:
- Framework gains enormous credibility
- Experimental validation of theoretical structure
- Clear path to further tests

**Either outcome advances knowledge. That is the point.**
