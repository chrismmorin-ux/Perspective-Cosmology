| ID | Question | Topic | Origin | Status | Priority | Context |
|----|----------|-------|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| EQ-001 | Derive Herm(2) = spacetime via spectral geometry or Jordan algebra | eval-map | S200/S211/S219 | RESOLVED | — | **S219**: [THEOREM] via irreducibility pigeonhole. su(2) irreducible under SU(2) + composition blindness forces non-commuting observables → S = Herm(2) forced without any correspondence axiom. CP-1 bridge formulated then eliminated. 10/10 + 10/10 PASS. |
| EQ-002 | Derive Om_m = 63/200 from physical mechanism | cosmology | S199/S230/S237/S248 | OPEN | HIGH | Triple-formula RED FLAG. **S248 (CNH)**: 63 = non-norm (inert prime 7 at odd power), 200 = norm (all split/ramified). Classification: matter = non-crystalline, dark energy = crystalline (137+63=200). CNH provides why-classification but NOT mechanism. S237: 63=dim(su(4))+dim(su(7)). Denominator 200 has no unified origin. Crystallization dynamics gaps block mechanism derivation. Score 13.3. |
| EQ-003 | Alpha Step 5: coset geometry mechanism for gauge kinetic term | alpha | S211 | OPEN | HIGH | Equipartition RULED OUT (first-order). Coset geometry ONLY remaining path. sin^2=28/121 converges with eval map. Score 10.7. |
| EQ-004 | Derive xi = 4/121 from vacuum alignment dynamics | collider | S210/S217/S228/S233 | RESOLVED (modulo [A-PHYSICAL]) | — | **S233**: With I-STRUCT-5 adopted, xi = n_d/n_c² = 4/121 follows from democratic counting on End(V). Same residual gap as EQ-007 (now resolved). 35/35 PASS. |
| EQ-005 | Resolve CC wrong sign (F-10) | gravity | S199/S230 | RESOLVED | — | **S230**: Sign convention error in framework analysis. Correct GR: Lambda = -8piG*V(eps*). V(eps*) < 0 gives Lambda > 0. F-10 resolved. Magnitude gap ~10^111 remains (standard CC problem). 10/10 PASS. |
| EQ-006 | Derive top Yukawa from SO(11) partial compositeness | collider | S212 | OPEN | HIGH | Spinorial resolved. y_t ~ 1 needed for m_H chain (lambda_H = 125/968). Score 6.7. |
| EQ-007 | Democratic counting mechanism (why 1/g² = dim of manifold) | gauge | S160/S218/S222/S224/S228/S233 | RESOLVED (modulo [A-PHYSICAL]) | — | **S233**: Step 6 adopted as I-STRUCT-5 [A-PHYSICAL]. Democratic metric [DERIVATION] from Schur's lemma (S224). Singlet criterion [CONJECTURE] (S222). Gap = one irreducible physical assumption (I-STRUCT-5). Three mechanisms 28/7/21, only democratic matches. 71/71 PASS total. Deeper derivation remains research direction (not required for resolution). |
| EQ-008 | Derive n_c/Im_H = 11/3 from vacuum polarization | gauge | S207 | OPEN | HIGH | All 3 SM beta coefficients decompose into framework numbers. Pattern-matching only. Needs first-principles calculation. |
| EQ-009 | Operational identification for Herm(2): precise axiom statement | eval-map | S211/S219 | RESOLVED | — | **S219**: Formalized as CP-1: "physical arena = measurement-outcome space." Exhaustion + uniqueness argument shows this is the ONLY option. Arguably definitional from framework premises. |
| EQ-010 | Fermion embedding (MCHM4 vs MCHM5) | collider | S210 | RESOLVED | — | **Resolved S212**: Spinorial (MCHM4). 15=1+2+4+8 matches SO(11) spinor 32. kappa_f=kappa_V. 23/23 PASS. |
| EQ-011 | CMB V0 inflationary amplitude expression | cosmology | S198/S199 | BLOCKED | HIGH | All 4 prior paths failed. Blocked by EQ-020 (mass scale f). Score 8.0. |
| EQ-012 | Cyclotomic 43 pattern: structural origin of Phi_6(7) | meta | S204/S211/S216/S226/S232/S235/S240 | OPEN | LOW | **S240**: Sign DERIVED (Killing form of gl(3,R): compact→positive, non-compact→negative). Magnitude |w_l|=C_2(complementary) remains [CONJECTURE]. Constraint system {w_0=1, sum=9, Frobenius=129, product=-12} uniquely selects formula, but Frobenius+product constraints conjectural. 13/13 PASS. Status: [CONJECTURE with structural support]. Remaining gap: derive Frobenius norm from Born-rule dynamics or find rep-theoretic identity for complementary Casimir coupling. Essentially complete unless new mechanism found. |
| EQ-013 | Dark matter mass: 3 competing formulas | dark-matter | S199/S242 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **S242**: Three formulas found — A: m_p×49/9=5.11 GeV, B: m_e×n_c²/n_d=15.5 MeV, C: m_e×(n_c−1)⁴=5.11 GeV. A/C agree 0.03% (coincidence via m_p/m_e), B differs ×330. None from first principles. Both sub-catalogs updated. dm_mass_discrepancy.py 10/10 PASS. Need: formula selection mechanism or experimental data. |
| EQ-014 | QCD string tension: lattice 17/24 validation | gauge | S152/S220 | OPEN | LOW | **S220**: Two modern determinations disagree by 5% (Knechtli 445±7 consistent, TUMQCD ~467 in tension). Data insufficient to confirm/falsify. Monitor for continuum-extrapolated Nf=2+1 with <2% error. No longer "quick win." |
| EQ-015 | Colored pNGB mass from first principles | collider | S210 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Crude 151 GeV, enhanced ~590 GeV, multi-site ~1.7 TeV. Need actual CW with specific composite sector. Score 6.5. |
| EQ-016 | Hom block representations (16+28+28+49) | eval-map | S200 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Identify SM content in each block from eval map. Score 6.0. |
| EQ-017 | Derive black hole entropy from crystallization | spacetime | IP-list | OPEN | MEDIUM | Create investigation file. Score 5.3. |
| EQ-018 | b2 < 0 sign from pure axioms (Layer 0) | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | b2 != 0 [DERIVATION]. Sign remains [CONJECTURE with physical motivation]. Need purely Layer 0 argument. |
| EQ-019 | c3 > 0: global vs dynamical selection | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Global minimum gives (2,9) for both signs. Dynamical curvature gives (4,7) when c3>0. Which is physical? |
| EQ-020 | Mass scale f derivation | collider/gravity | S217/S233 | RESOLVED (modulo [A-PHYSICAL]) | — | **S233**: f = v·n_c/2 = 1354 GeV follows from xi = 4/121 (EQ-004, now resolved). Democratic counting gap closed by I-STRUCT-5 adoption. Still blocks EQ-011 (V₀ needs f + additional mechanism). |
| EQ-021 | Landau coefficient magnitudes | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Signs mostly resolved. Magnitudes remain free [A-STRUCTURAL]. CW or non-perturbative constraints? |
| EQ-022 | Gauge kinetic term normalization | alpha | S211/S218/S222/S224/S228/S233 | RESOLVED (subordinate to EQ-007) | — | **S233**: κ=1 follows from I-STRUCT-5 + canonical normalization. Not independent of EQ-007. Resolved when EQ-007 resolved. |
| EQ-023 | Derive lambda_0 = 1/O from CW form factors | collider | S179 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Pi^2 cancellation shown. WHY 1/dim(O)? |
| EQ-024 | kappa_lambda (triple Higgs coupling) verification | collider | S212 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Likely (1-2xi)/sqrt(1-xi) ~ 0.950 for MCHM4. Must verify for MCHM4 potential specifically. |
| EQ-025 | Nu_R prediction from spinor embedding | particles | S212 | OPEN | MEDIUM | SO(11) spinor 32 = 16 + 16'. One 16 = 15 SM + nu_R. Structural prediction. Connects to neutrino mass (S167). |
| EQ-026 | Vacuum polarization from tilt Lagrangian | collider | topic | OPEN | MEDIUM | Derive QFT loop calculation from tilt dynamics. Open path in collider topic. |
| EQ-027 | Colored pNGB branching ratios (beta parameter) | collider | S213 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Needed to sharpen HL-LHC scalar leptoquark prediction. |
| EQ-028 | B-meson anomalies (R(D)/R(D*)) | collider | topic | OPEN | LOW | Phase V. Blocked on CKM derivation. May connect to mass-dependent effects. |
| EQ-029 | 95 GeV scalar excess monitoring | collider | S213 | OPEN | LOW | MONITOR: CMS+ATLAS Run 3 full dataset (2025-2026). Framework says NO. 5-sigma kills AXM_0109. 3.1-sigma combined currently. |
| EQ-030 | Missing verification scripts (29 count) | quality | S208/S209 | OPEN | LOW | Biggest remaining structural debt. Many in archived investigations. Remove references or create scripts? |
| EQ-031 | Missing "Last Updated" headers (90 count) | quality | S208/S209 | OPEN | LOW | Batch operation, no physics reasoning needed. |
| EQ-032 | Primordial GW r = 0.035 monitoring | cosmology | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Wait for CMB-S4 (~2028). No session work needed now. Score 5.0. |
| EQ-033 | EWSB vacuum stability bounds | collider | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Depends on top Yukawa (EQ-006) first. Score 4.0. |
| EQ-034 | AXM_0117 at meta-levels (universality) | meta | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Terminal gap=1 regardless. 7,3,1 cascade needs it. Score 4.0. |
| EQ-035 | Physical meaning of terminal direction | meta | S201 | OPEN | LOW | Recursive gap tower: what does the terminal direction in the tower represent physically? |
| EQ-036 | Oblique parameters S/T monitoring | collider | S210 | OPEN | LOW | Currently at edge of bounds. Monitor with future precision EW data. |
| EQ-037 | Bridge Planck-scale tilt dynamics to IR effective theory | collider | topic | OPEN | LOW | Open path in collider topic. Long-term theoretical project. |
