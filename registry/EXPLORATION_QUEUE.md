| EQ-006 | Derive top Yukawa from SO(11) partial compositeness | collider | S212/S290 | SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED | LOW | **S290**: y_t = 1 from full compositeness [CONJECTURE]. No elementary sector -> sin(theta)=1; NDA -> Y_* cancels. CG cancels (Clifford uniformity). m_t(tree) = v/sqrt(2) = 174.10 GeV, Band A (0.82%). m_H chain closed: y_t=1 -> lambda_H=125/968 -> m_H=125.13 GeV. **Remaining gap**: y_b/y_t ~ 0.024 within 3rd gen (SU(2) suppression needed); NDA mass relation is [A-STRUCTURAL]. 24/24 PASS (2 scripts). |
| ~~EQ-007~~ | ~~Democratic counting mechanism~~ | — | — | RESOLVED | — | Moved to Recently Resolved. |
| EQ-008 | Derive n_c/Im_H = 11/3 from vacuum polarization | gauge | S207/S295/S296 | OPEN (reduced) | MEDIUM | **S296**: 5 approaches tested. D=4 quadratic identity (D-1)^2+1=D(D+1)/2 holds ONLY at D=1,4 [THEOREM]. n_c=Im_H^2+2 from Cayley-Dickson+Frobenius [THEOREM]. 10/3=Im_H+1/Im_H=S285 glueball intercept. Paramagnetic-octonion [CONJECTURE]. 2 DEAD ENDS (Grassmannian, Casimir). Upgraded to [CONJECTURE with structural support]. Gap IRREDUCIBLE: QFT loop <-> div alg mode mapping is [A-PHYSICAL]. 94/94 PASS (5 scripts). |
| ~~EQ-009~~ | ~~Herm(2) operational identification~~ | — | — | RESOLVED | — | Moved to Recently Resolved. |
| ~~EQ-010~~ | ~~Fermion embedding (MCHM4 vs MCHM5)~~ | — | — | RESOLVED | — | Moved to Recently Resolved. |
| EQ-011 | CMB V0 inflationary amplitude expression | cosmology | S198/S199/S295 | OPEN (candidate) | HIGH | **S295**: V_0 = alpha^4/C = alpha^4 * n_c/N_colored [CONJECTURE, HRS 5]. A_s(pred) = 2.090e-9 (0.41%, 0.29 sigma). Same C=24/11 as alpha correction. Found by search, not derived. 23/24 PASS (2 scripts). Needs derivation mechanism. |
| EQ-012 | Cyclotomic 43 pattern: structural origin of Phi_6(7) | meta | S204/S211/S216/S226/S232/S235/S240/S285 | ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE | LOW | **S240**: Sign DERIVED (Killing form of gl(3,R): compact→positive, non-compact→negative). Magnitude |w_l|=C_2(complementary) remains [CONJECTURE]. Constraint system {w_0=1, sum=9, Frobenius=129, product=-12} uniquely selects formula, but Frobenius+product constraints conjectural. 13/13 PASS. Status: [CONJECTURE with structural support]. Remaining gap: derive Frobenius norm from Born-rule dynamics or find rep-theoretic identity for complementary Casimir coupling. Essentially complete unless new mechanism found. |
| EQ-013 | Dark matter mass: 3 competing formulas | dark-matter | S199/S242 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **S242**: Three formulas found — A: m_p×49/9=5.11 GeV, B: m_e×n_c²/n_d=15.5 MeV, C: m_e×(n_c−1)⁴=5.11 GeV. A/C agree 0.03% (coincidence via m_p/m_e), B differs ×330. None from first principles. Both sub-catalogs updated. dm_mass_discrepancy.py 10/10 PASS. Need: formula selection mechanism or experimental data. |
| EQ-014 | QCD string tension: lattice 17/24 validation | gauge | S152/S220 | OPEN | LOW | **S220**: Two modern determinations disagree by 5% (Knechtli 445±7 consistent, TUMQCD ~467 in tension). Data insufficient to confirm/falsify. Monitor for continuum-extrapolated Nf=2+1 with <2% error. No longer "quick win." |
| EQ-015 | Colored pNGB mass from first principles | collider | S210 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Crude 151 GeV, enhanced ~590 GeV, multi-site ~1.7 TeV. Need actual CW with specific composite sector. Score 6.5. |

| EQ-018 | b2 < 0 sign from pure axioms (Layer 0) | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | b2 != 0 [DERIVATION]. Sign remains [CONJECTURE with physical motivation]. Need purely Layer 0 argument. |
| EQ-019 | c3 > 0: global vs dynamical selection | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Global minimum gives (2,9) for both signs. Dynamical curvature gives (4,7) when c3>0. Which is physical? |
| ~~EQ-020~~ | ~~Mass scale f derivation~~ | — | — | RESOLVED | — | Moved to Recently Resolved. |
| EQ-021 | Landau coefficient magnitudes | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Signs mostly resolved. Magnitudes remain free [A-STRUCTURAL]. CW or non-perturbative constraints? |

| EQ-023 | Derive lambda_0 = 1/O from CW form factors | collider | S179 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Pi^2 cancellation shown. WHY 1/dim(O)? |
| EQ-024 | kappa_lambda (triple Higgs coupling) verification | collider | S212 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Likely (1-2xi)/sqrt(1-xi) ~ 0.950 for MCHM4. Must verify for MCHM4 potential specifically. |
| EQ-025 | Nu_R prediction from spinor embedding | particles | S212 | OPEN | MEDIUM | SO(11) spinor 32 = 16 + 16'. One 16 = 15 SM + nu_R. Structural prediction. Connects to neutrino mass (S167). |
| ~~EQ-026~~ | ~~Vacuum polarization from tilt Lagrangian~~ | — | — | RESOLVED | — | Moved to Recently Resolved. |
| EQ-027 | Colored pNGB branching ratios (beta parameter) | collider | S213 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Needed to sharpen HL-LHC scalar leptoquark prediction. |
| EQ-028 | B-meson anomalies (R(D)/R(D*)) | collider | topic | OPEN | LOW | Phase V. Blocked on CKM derivation. May connect to mass-dependent effects. |
| EQ-029 | 95 GeV scalar excess monitoring | collider | S213 | OPEN | LOW | MONITOR: CMS+ATLAS Run 3 full dataset (2025-2026). Framework says NO. 5-sigma kills AXM_0109. 3.1-sigma combined currently. |
| EQ-030 | Missing verification scripts (29 count) | quality | S208/S209 | OPEN | LOW | Biggest remaining structural debt. Many in archived investigations. Remove references or create scripts? |
| EQ-031 | Missing "Last Updated" headers (90 count) | quality | S208/S209 | OPEN | LOW | Batch operation, no physics reasoning needed. |
| EQ-032 | Primordial GW r = 0.035 monitoring | cosmology | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Wait for CMB-S4 (~2028). No session work needed now. Score 5.0. |
| EQ-033 | EWSB vacuum stability bounds | collider | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Depends on top Yukawa (EQ-006) first. Score 4.0. |
| EQ-034 | AXM_0117 at meta-levels (universality) | meta | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Terminal gap=1 regardless. 7,3,1 cascade needs it. Score 4.0. |
| EQ-035 | Physical meaning of terminal direction | meta | S201 | OPEN | LOW | Recursive gap tower: what does the terminal direction in the tower represent physically? |
| EQ-036 | Oblique parameters S/T monitoring | collider | S210 | OPEN | LOW | Currently at edge of bounds. Monitor with future precision EW data. |
| EQ-037 | Bridge Planck-scale tilt dynamics to IR effective theory | collider | topic | OPEN | LOW | Open path in collider topic. Long-term theoretical project. |
| ~~EQ-038~~ | ~~Vol(Gr(4,11)) quantization~~ | — | — | RESOLVED | — | Moved to Recently Resolved. |
| EQ-039 | Derive C=24/11 radiative correction to alpha from composite sector loops | alpha | S262/S266/S269/S272/S276/S279/S282/S283 | OPEN (reduced) | MEDIUM | **S283**: Double-trace mechanism RESOLVED [CONJECTURE]: Band C specific, End(V) trace normalization. All 8 coefficients are framework monomials (21/21 PASS). cos(theta_W) CORRECTED from Band B to Band A (tree-level sin^2+cos^2 mismatch, 17/17 PASS). C_3 three-loop NEGATIVE RESULT: C_3~5.7, no clean match, 2.0 sigma not significant (17/17 PASS). **Remaining gap**: Band A testable predictions (m_tau/m_mu, alpha_s); tree-level sin^2+cos^2 mismatch; coefficient unification principle. |
| EQ-040 | Pi-power self-referential structure: is there a deeper explanation? | constants/pi | S265 | OPEN | LOW |
| EQ-041 | Derive Landau coefficients (a_3, a_4) for Z_3 confinement potential from framework | gauge/YM | S268/S277/S281/S284 | DEFERRED | LOW | Z_3-invariant Landau potential V = a_2*r^2 + 2*a_3*r^3*cos(3*theta) + a_4*r^4 formalized in S268. **S284**: a_2 = n_d^2*sigma/2 = 8*sigma now [DERIVATION with A-PHYSICAL]. a_3 and a_4 remain free [A-STRUCTURAL]. Would need CW from O-channel tilt dynamics -- essentially the Millennium Prize. Investigation promoted to CANONICAL (L<=1 spectrum) without needing a_3/a_4. Relates to EQ-021. **Blocking condition**: Non-perturbative calculation of O-channel effective potential. Status: DEFERRED indefinitely. |
