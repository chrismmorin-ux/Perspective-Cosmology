| ID | Question | Topic | Origin | Status | Priority | Context |
|----|----------|-------|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| EQ-001 | Derive Herm(2) = spacetime via spectral geometry or Jordan algebra | eval-map | S200/S211/S219 | RESOLVED | — | **S219**: Exhaustion (End(W) is all accessible) + Uniqueness (Herm(2) ONLY subspace with real eigenvalues + Lorentzian metric + 1+3 split) + CP-1 ("physical arena = measurement-outcome space"). Gap closed to standard theory-physics bridge. 10/10 PASS. |
| EQ-002 | Derive Om_m = 63/200 from physical mechanism | cosmology | S199 | BLOCKED | HIGH | Triple-formula RED FLAG. All S94-S126 attempts failed. Blocked by EQ-005 (CC wrong sign). Score 13.3. |
| EQ-003 | Alpha Step 5: coset geometry mechanism for gauge kinetic term | alpha | S211 | OPEN | HIGH | Equipartition RULED OUT (first-order). Coset geometry ONLY remaining path. sin^2=28/121 converges with eval map. Score 10.7. |
| EQ-004 | Derive xi = 4/121 from vacuum alignment dynamics | collider | S210/S217 | OPEN | HIGH | **S217**: Democratic Bilinear Principle — xi = n_d/n_c^2 = N_Higgs/dim(End(V)). Unified with EQ-007 (sin^2=28/121) and EQ-020 (mass scale f) under one principle. Bernoulli p=4/11. Gap: "why democratic not Dynkin?" 35/35 PASS. |
| EQ-005 | Resolve CC wrong sign (F-10) | gravity | S199 | OPEN | HIGH | V(eps*) = -alpha^6 M_Pl^2/2 < 0 but Lambda > 0. Active contradiction. Score 9.3. |
| EQ-006 | Derive top Yukawa from SO(11) partial compositeness | collider | S212 | OPEN | HIGH | Spinorial resolved. y_t ~ 1 needed for m_H chain (lambda_H = 125/968). Score 6.7. |
| EQ-007 | Two-regime coupling mechanism (EW: coset dim, strong: group dim) | gauge | S160/S218 | OPEN | HIGH | **S218 REFINED**: SU(3) mode test done. N_charged=94 FAILS, only dim(SU(3))=8 works. **Structural theorem T_SU2=T_SU3=22** (one-loop predicts α₂=α₃, WRONG). α₃/α₂=7/2=3.5 at 0.34%. Gap refined: why coset dim (28) for SU(2) and group dim (8) for SU(3)? Partial: coset homogeneity + first-order transition. 15/15 PASS. |
| EQ-008 | Derive n_c/Im_H = 11/3 from vacuum polarization | gauge | S207 | OPEN | HIGH | All 3 SM beta coefficients decompose into framework numbers. Pattern-matching only. Needs first-principles calculation. |
| EQ-009 | Operational identification for Herm(2): precise axiom statement | eval-map | S211/S219 | RESOLVED | — | **S219**: Formalized as CP-1: "physical arena = measurement-outcome space." Exhaustion + uniqueness argument shows this is the ONLY option. Arguably definitional from framework premises. |
| EQ-010 | Fermion embedding (MCHM4 vs MCHM5) | collider | S210 | RESOLVED | — | **Resolved S212**: Spinorial (MCHM4). 15=1+2+4+8 matches SO(11) spinor 32. kappa_f=kappa_V. 23/23 PASS. |
| EQ-011 | CMB V0 inflationary amplitude expression | cosmology | S198/S199 | BLOCKED | HIGH | All 4 prior paths failed. Blocked by EQ-020 (mass scale f). Score 8.0. |
| EQ-012 | Cyclotomic 43 pattern: structural origin of Phi_6(7) | meta | S204/S211/S216 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **S216**: Three-sector decomposition (u(11)->u(4)+u(7)+cross). Denominator selection structurally explained [DERIVATION]. m_s/m_c=1/Phi_6(4) NEW. 5 formulas mapped to sectors. Numerators + sector assignment remain [CONJECTURE]. 11/11 PASS. Remaining gap: derive mass-octonion coupling from axioms. |
| EQ-013 | Dark matter 5 GeV mass mechanism | dark-matter | S199 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Derive production cross-section; compare SuperCDMS sensitivity. Score 7.5. |
| EQ-014 | QCD string tension: lattice 17/24 validation | gauge | S152/S220 | OPEN | LOW | **S220**: Two modern determinations disagree by 5% (Knechtli 445±7 consistent, TUMQCD ~467 in tension). Data insufficient to confirm/falsify. Monitor for continuum-extrapolated Nf=2+1 with <2% error. No longer "quick win." |
| EQ-015 | Colored pNGB mass from first principles | collider | S210 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Crude 151 GeV, enhanced ~590 GeV, multi-site ~1.7 TeV. Need actual CW with specific composite sector. Score 6.5. |
| EQ-016 | Hom block representations (16+28+28+49) | eval-map | S200 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Identify SM content in each block from eval map. Score 6.0. |
| EQ-017 | Derive black hole entropy from crystallization | spacetime | IP-list | OPEN | MEDIUM | Create investigation file. Score 5.3. |
| EQ-018 | b2 < 0 sign from pure axioms (Layer 0) | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | b2 != 0 [DERIVATION]. Sign remains [CONJECTURE with physical motivation]. Need purely Layer 0 argument. |
| EQ-019 | c3 > 0: global vs dynamical selection | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Global minimum gives (2,9) for both signs. Dynamical curvature gives (4,7) when c3>0. Which is physical? |
| EQ-020 | Mass scale f derivation | collider/gravity | S217 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **S217**: f = v*n_c/2 = 1354 GeV follows from xi = 4/121 via Democratic Bilinear Principle. Unified with EQ-004/EQ-007. Four approaches surveyed (B not independent, D ruled out, C blocked, A promising). Blocks EQ-011. Residual gap: "why democratic?" |
| EQ-021 | Landau coefficient magnitudes | crystallization | S207 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Signs mostly resolved. Magnitudes remain free [A-STRUCTURAL]. CW or non-perturbative constraints? |
| EQ-022 | Gauge kinetic term normalization | alpha | S211/S218 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **S218**: T_SU2=T_SU3=22 proves one-loop wrong. SU(3) uses dim(SU(3))=8, not mode count. WHY coupling = coset volume fraction (EW) or group dim (strong)? Merged with EQ-007. |
| EQ-023 | Derive lambda_0 = 1/O from CW form factors | collider | S179 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Pi^2 cancellation shown. WHY 1/dim(O)? |
| EQ-024 | kappa_lambda (triple Higgs coupling) verification | collider | S212 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Likely (1-2xi)/sqrt(1-xi) ~ 0.950 for MCHM4. Must verify for MCHM4 potential specifically. |
| EQ-025 | Nu_R prediction from spinor embedding | particles | S212 | OPEN | MEDIUM | SO(11) spinor 32 = 16 + 16'. One 16 = 15 SM + nu_R. Structural prediction. Connects to neutrino mass (S167). |
| EQ-026 | Vacuum polarization from tilt Lagrangian | collider | topic | OPEN | MEDIUM | Derive QFT loop calculation from tilt dynamics. Open path in collider topic. |
| EQ-027 | Colored pNGB branching ratios (beta parameter) | collider | S213 | OPEN | MEDIUM | Needed to sharpen HL-LHC scalar leptoquark prediction. |
| EQ-028 | B-meson anomalies (R(D)/R(D*)) | collider | topic | OPEN | LOW | Phase V. Blocked on CKM derivation. May connect to mass-dependent effects. |
| EQ-029 | 95 GeV scalar excess monitoring | collider | S213 | OPEN | LOW | MONITOR: CMS+ATLAS Run 3 full dataset (2025-2026). Framework says NO. 5-sigma kills AXM_0109. 3.1-sigma combined currently. |
| EQ-030 | Missing verification scripts (29 count) | quality | S208/S209 | OPEN | LOW | Biggest remaining structural debt. Many in archived investigations. Remove references or create scripts? |
| EQ-031 | Missing "Last Updated" headers (90 count) | quality | S208/S209 | OPEN | LOW | Batch operation, no physics reasoning needed. |
| EQ-032 | Primordial GW r = 0.035 monitoring | cosmology | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Wait for CMB-S4 (~2028). No session work needed now. Score 5.0. |
| EQ-033 | EWSB vacuum stability bounds | collider | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Depends on top Yukawa (EQ-006) first. Score 4.0. |
| EQ-034 | AXM_0117 at meta-levels (universality) | meta | IP-list | OPEN | LOW | Terminal gap=1 regardless. 7,3,1 cascade needs it. Score 4.0. |
| EQ-035 | Physical meaning of terminal direction | meta | S201 | OPEN | LOW | Recursive gap tower: what does the terminal direction in the tower represent physically? |
| EQ-036 | Oblique parameters S/T monitoring | collider | S210 | OPEN | LOW | Currently at edge of bounds. Monitor with future precision EW data. |
| EQ-037 | Bridge Planck-scale tilt dynamics to IR effective theory | collider | topic | OPEN | LOW | Open path in collider topic. Long-term theoretical project. |
