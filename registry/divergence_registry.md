# Divergence Registry

**Purpose**: Track where Perspective Cosmology differs from standard physics. These might be:
- Predictions worth testing
- Errors needing correction
- Hints about missing framework elements
- Genuinely novel insights

**DO NOT DISCARD** until evaluated by someone with physics expertise.

## Classification

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **PREDICTION** | Framework says X, standard physics doesn't; testable |
| **PATTERN** | Framework finds pattern; standard physics has no explanation |
| **TENSION** | Framework implies X, but X seems inconsistent |
| **UNEXPLORED** | Framework might address this, but we haven't tried |

## D1: Log vs Power Scaling of Couplings

**Type**: PATTERN

**What we find**:
```
α   = 2/ln|Π|       ≈ 1/137    (logarithmic)
α_W = 9/ln|Π|       ≈ 1/30     (logarithmic)
α_G = 30/|Π|^(1/3)  ≈ 10^-39   (power law)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Explains 10^37 hierarchy between gravity and EM
- Single parameter |Π| for all couplings
- Different functional forms, not just different values

**Standard physics says**: Couplings are independent or unify at GUT scale through RG flow

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is there any known reason log vs power should differ for gravity?
2. Does RG flow support or contradict this pattern?
3. Is |Π| ≈ 10^118 meaningful cosmologically?

**Status**: Most promising contribution if real

## D2: sin²θ_W = 2/9 = n_weak/n_color²

**Type**: PATTERN

**What we find**:
```
sin²θ_W = 2/9 = 0.2222...
On-shell measured: 0.2229 (0.3% match)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Only dimension ratio that works
- Involves meaningful physics quantities (weak/color)
- Matches tree-level (on-shell) specifically

**Standard physics says**: sin²θ_W = 3/8 at GUT scale, runs to ~0.23

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is there a known relationship between sin²θ_W and N_c²?
2. Why would tree-level match 2/9 while MS-bar doesn't?
3. Is this a coincidence or does dimensional counting explain it?

**Unexplored connection**: How does 3/8 (GUT value) relate to 2/9?

**Status**: Intriguing but mechanism unknown

---

## D3: γ-Transition at Compton Wavelength

**Type**: PREDICTION (if formulas were derived)

**What we claim**:
```
γ(m, L) = λ_C / (λ_C + L)

At L = λ_C: γ = 0.5 (critical point)
- γ > 0.5: "quantum regime" (L < λ_C)
- γ < 0.5: "classical regime" (L > λ_C)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Compton wavelength as fundamental transition scale
- Not just "quantum vs classical" but specific transition point
- Would predict anomalies at L ~ λ_C

**Standard physics says**: No special transition at Compton wavelength

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is there any hint of Compton-scale physics in decoherence?
2. Does the Compton wavelength appear in any transition phenomena?
3. Is this testable with current technology?

**Status**: Interesting but formula is ansatz

---

## D4: Gravity from "Different Content"

**Type**: UNEXPLORED

**What we suggest**:
```
Γ_grav ∝ h(γ) where h(γ) = 2γ(1-γ)

Physical meaning: Gravity requires BOTH shared and different content
- Shared content: common reference frame (proportion γ)
- Different content: what gravitationally decoheres (proportion 1-γ)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Gravity isn't just "mass attracts mass"
- Requires relationship between perspectives
- Would explain why gravity is relational

**Standard physics says**: Gravity couples to stress-energy tensor

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is there a relational interpretation of gravity consistent with GR?
2. Does this relate to Mach's principle?
3. How would this connect to diffeomorphism invariance?

**Status**: Conceptually interesting, no derivation

---

## D5: α from Crystal-Defect Interface (UPDATED 2026-01-26)

**Type**: PATTERN (striking numerical match)

**Formula discovered**:
```
α = 1/(n_perceived² + n_total²)
  = 1/(4² + 11²)
  = 1/137

Where:
  n_perceived = 4 (spacetime dimensions in defect U)
  n_total = 11 (M-theory dimensions in crystal C)
```

**Accuracy**: 0.026% error from measured α = 1/137.035999

**Physical interpretation**:
- Crystal C has 11 dimensions (full orthogonality)
- Defect U perceives 4 dimensions (partial orthogonality)
- α measures "interface complexity" between crystal and defect
- Sum of squares: Pythagorean structure (137 is Pythagorean prime)

**Prior work**: Sluyser (2016) noted 137 = 4² + 11² but provided no derivation. Our framework gives physical mechanism: perspective as defect in crystalline structure.

**The 0.036 correction**:
- 137.036 - 137 = 0.036
- Possibly: 3.5% visible matter fraction (Sluyser)
- Or: radiative corrections / geometric fine structure

**Standard physics says**: No derivation of α from M-theory dimensions exists.

**Questions remaining**:
1. Why is interface measure n₁² + n₂²? (geometric derivation needed)
2. Why specifically 11 dimensions? (M-theory import or derivable?)
3. Why EM coupling and not other forces?
4. Do other couplings fit similar patterns? (α_W ≈ 1/29 = 1/(5² + 2²)?)

**Status**: CONJECTURE — most accurate α formula with physical interpretation

**See**: physics/alpha_crystal_interface.md for full analysis

## D6: Static |Π| (Block Universe)

**Type**: PREDICTION (from constraint)

**What we find**:
```
If |Π| varied cosmologically:
- α would vary: Δα/α ~ 10^-2 over cosmic time
- Ruled out by observation (< 10^-5)

Therefore: |Π| must be cosmologically static
```

**Why this matters**:
- Framework predicts block universe interpretation
- |Π| is total (past + present + future)
- Not compatible with "expanding perspective count"

**Standard physics says**: Block universe is one interpretation, not a prediction

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is this a genuine prediction or just consistency?
2. Does block universe have other testable consequences?
3. How does this relate to time in GR?

**Status**: Interesting but may be trivial

---

## D7: Three Generations from Dimension Matching

**Type**: PATTERN (weak)

**What we claim**:
```
n_gen = min(n_spatial, n_color, n_stability) = 3
```

**Why this matters**:
- Would explain why exactly 3 generations
- Connects to spatial dimension count

**Standard physics says**: Number of generations unexplained, but constrained by anomaly cancellation

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is there a known relationship between n_gen and dimension?
2. Does anomaly cancellation relate to our argument?
3. What would 4th generation imply?

**Status**: Weak argument, not derivation

---

## D8: Product Relation α_G × α_W × |Π|^(1/3) ≈ 1

**Type**: PATTERN

**What we find**:
```
α_G × α_W × |Π|^(1/3) = (5.9×10^-39) × (1/30) × (10^40) ≈ 2
```

**Why this matters**:
- Connects gravity and weak force through |Π|
- Within factor of 2 of unity
- Would be exact if formulas are right

**Standard physics says**: No such relation

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is this known or novel?
2. Is factor of 2 significant or within uncertainty?
3. Does GUT unification predict any such relation?

**Status**: Derived from coupling pattern; not independent

---

## D9: Decoherence Suppression at Small Scales

**Type**: PREDICTION (if h(γ) were derived)

**What we find**:
```
Γ_grav = Γ_standard × h(γ) where h(γ) → 0 as L << λ_C
```

**Why this matters**:
- Gravitational decoherence suppressed at quantum scales
- Differs from Penrose-Diosi (which has no such suppression)
- But suppression makes framework LESS testable

**Standard physics says**: Penrose-Diosi has no γ-dependent suppression

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is suppression at small scales physically reasonable?
2. Does this relate to UV/IR mixing in QG?
3. Is there any way to test this suppression?

**Status**: Might be important, might be artifact

---

## D10: Intrinsic Time Scale τ₀ from |Π|

**Type**: UNEXPLORED

**What we find** (partial):
```
τ₀ ~ t_H / √|Π| ≈ 10^-42 s (within ~20× of t_P)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Would derive Planck time from cosmological |Π|
- Connects microscopic and cosmological scales
- Not quite right (factor of 20), but suggestive

**Questions for physicist**:
1. Is t_H/√|Π| meaningful?
2. Does this relate to holographic bounds?
3. What would fix the factor of 20?

**Status**: Suggestive but not exact

---

## Summary: What to Preserve

### Most Valuable (don't lose these)
- D1: Log vs power scaling — best hierarchy explanation
- D2: sin²θ_W = 2/9 — sharpest numerical match
- D5: α as geometry — unexplored fresh direction

### Interesting but Weak
- D3: γ-transition — interesting if formulas justified
- D4: Relational gravity — conceptually novel
- D8: Product relation — follows from D1

### May be Trivial
- D6: Static |Π| — consistency rather than prediction
- D7: Three generations — weak argument

### May be Artifacts
- D9: Decoherence suppression — depends on ansatz h(γ)
- D10: τ₀ from |Π| — approximate only

## The Key Question

Which of these divergences represent:
1. **Novel physics** worth pursuing
2. **Known ideas** in different language
3. **Mathematical coincidences**
4. **Missing elements** that would complete the framework

A theoretical physicist could help categorize these.
