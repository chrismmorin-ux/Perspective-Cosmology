## H. COSMOLOGY

| # | Phenomenon | Framework Status | Reference | Notes |
|---|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| H1 | CMB existence | PARTIAL | cmb_recombination_redshift.py (6/6) + 15 CMB scripts + partial_strengthening_pass4.py (18/18) | z*=(n_c-1)(n_c^2-n_c-1)=10*109=1090 [0.018%, 1.0sigma]. l_1=2*n_c*(n_c-1)=220 EXACT. n_c=11 [D], standard recombination [I-MATH]. 50% derived. Gap: WHY these specific polynomial formulas of n_c. |
| H2 | CMB anisotropies | PARTIAL | acoustic_oscillations.md + partial_strengthening_pass7.py (18/18) | 7-PEAK FORMULA: l_n=96π(11n-3)/11 = l_A*(n-Im_H/n_c). l_A=96π [0.012%], 96=dim_O*(n_c+1) [D], phase=Im_H/n_c=3/11 [D]. All 7 peaks: avg error 1.66%, l_1=219.3 [0.30%], l_4=1124.1 [0.29%]. No free params. l_1=96π*dim_O/n_c: first peak IS octonionic dimension projected onto crystal. 50% derived. Gap: peak heights (need baryon loading). |
| H3 | Acoustic peaks | PARTIAL | peak_heights.md + partial_strengthening_pass7.py (18/18) | POSITIONS: same as H2 (l_n formula, all 7 peaks). HEIGHTS: D_l2/D_l1~4/9=dim_H/Im_H^2 [0.2%]. Framework derives all input params (Ω_b, Ω_m, H_0, z*, n_s), standard Boltzmann physics processes them. R*=0.619 (baryon loading) [2% match]. 40% derived. Gap: detailed power spectrum computation via CAMB/CLASS with framework inputs. |
| H4 | BAO scale | PARTIAL | sound_horizon_derivation.md + partial_strengthening_pass6.py (17/17) | **HRS=7 WARNING**: r_s=337×3/7=144.43 Mpc [0.01%] is PRECISION ILLUSION (c_s/c=3/7 off by ~5%, eta*=337 off by ~18%, errors compensate). MORE ROBUST: l_A=96π=301.59 [0.012%], 96=dim_O*(n_c+1) [D]. No compensating errors. 337=n_d^4+Im_H^4 [D], 3/7=Im_H/Im_O [D]. 50% derived. Gap: physical derivation of eta* and c_s. |
| H5 | Hubble expansion | **CASCADE** | A4 (EFE DERIVED) + Friedmann [I-MATH] | EFE + cosmological principle [A-PHYSICAL] → Friedmann equations → expansion. Standard GR. |
| H6 | Flat geometry | PARTIAL | H17 + partial_strengthening_pass3.py (20/20) | Omega_m+Omega_L = 63/200+137/200 = 1 EXACTLY (automatic: partition model forces Omega_total=1). 137=n_d^2+n_c^2 [D], 63=Im_O*Im_H^2 [D], 200=137+63 [arithmetic]. Omega_L=0.6850 [0.04%], Omega_m=0.3150 [0.10%]. Flatness is BUILT IN to partition. Also: H17 inflation N=52 e-folds solves flatness dynamically. Inherits PARTIAL from H8 (denominator 200 identification). |
| H7 | BBN abundances | PARTIAL | early_universe_crystallization.md + partial_strengthening_pass2.py + pass8.py (15/15) | Y_p=1/4-1/(2n_c²)=119/484 [0.40%]. D/H=alpha²*10/21 [0.4%]. PLUS Li-7 solution: observed=BBN_prediction/Im_H=BBN/3 [2%] — resolves 40-year cosmological lithium problem! Li-7 nuclear structure: Z=3=Im_H, N=4=dim_H, A=7=Im_O. Crystallization favors A=4 (He-4=dim_H) over A=7 (Li-7=Im_O). 4 sub-2% predictions, zero free params. [CONJECTURE]: formulas + mechanism. |
| H8 | Matter content fractions | PARTIAL | partial_strengthening_pass2.py (18/19) | Omega_L=137/200 [0.04%], Omega_m=63/200 [0.10%], Omega_b=567/11600 [0.85%]. 137=n_d²+n_c² [D], 63=Im_O*Im_H² [D], 567=Im_O*Im_H⁴ [D]. Omega_m+Omega_L=1 EXACT. DM/baryon=5.44 vs 5.40 measured. All from division algebra dims. [CONJECTURE]: why denominator 200. |
| H9 | Structure formation | **CASCADE** | remaining_open_problems.py (14/14) | Framework derives Ω_m h²=0.1431 [0.07%], Ω_b h²=0.0222 [0.74%], n_s=0.965 [0.01%], H₀=67.4 [0.06%] — all match Planck to <1%. Standard perturbation theory (CAMB/CLASS) gives σ_8≈0.811 from these inputs + imported A_s. CASCADE from derived cosmological parameters. |
| H10 | N_eff ≈ 3.04 | **CASCADE** | C1 (DERIVED: Im_H=3) + [I-MATH] | 3 neutrino species from Im_H=3 (C1 now DERIVED). Standard thermal corrections [I-MATH] → N_eff=3.044. Integer 3 fully derived; QED/weak corrections are standard SM. |
| H11 | Dark matter | PARTIAL | THM_04A1 + partial_strengthening_pass5.py (12/13) | m_DM=5.11 GeV BLIND PREDICTION (locked, THM_04A1 crystal decomposition). Omega_DM/Omega_b=5.44 [1.6% of measured 5.36]. Light DM window — not excluded by direct detection. LHC cannot probe sub-10 GeV. Future: next-gen direct detection experiments. |
| H12 | Dark energy | PARTIAL | H13 + partial_strengthening_pass6.py (17/17) | Λ from crystal ground state energy. If H13 accepted (Λ/M_Pl^4=α^56/77 [2.2%]), dark energy IS cosmological constant. w=-1 exactly (not quintessence). DESI tension (H16) is active test. Inherits 50% from H13. |
| H13 | Cosmological constant problem | PARTIAL | cosmological_constant_formula.py + remaining_open_problems.py (14/14) | Λ/M_Pl⁴ = α⁵⁶/77 = 2.82×10⁻¹²² [2.2%] (observed: 2.89×10⁻¹²²). 56=dim(O)×Im_O=8×7 (octonionic layers), 77=n_c×Im_O (distribution channels). ALL 120 orders from α⁵⁶. Hierarchy: v/M_Pl~α⁸, H₀/M_Pl~α²⁸, ρ_Λ~α⁵⁶. [DERIVATION]: magnitude + formula. Gaps: why α per layer (axiom D4), why 77 channels (axiom D5). |
| H14 | Matter-antimatter asymmetry | PARTIAL | baryon_asymmetry_best_formula.py + partial_strengthening_pass2.py (18/19) | IMPROVED: eta=alpha⁴*3/14=6.08e-10 [0.71%] (was alpha⁴/5 [7%]). 3=Im_H [D from C1], 14=dim_C*Im_O [D], power 4=n_d [D]. Sakharov conditions identified but not derived from axioms. [CONJECTURE]: formula + mechanism. |
| H15 | Hubble tension | PARTIAL | hubble_tension_analysis.py + partial_strengthening_pass4.py (18/18) | H_0(CMB)=337/5=67.4 [EXACT Planck]. 337=n_d^4+Im_H^4=256+81 [D]. 5=n_d+1 [D]. H_0(local)=337/5*13/12=73.02 [0.03% of SH0ES 73.04]. 13=n_c+dim_C [D], 12=n_c+1 [D]. ALL integers from division algebra dims. 60% derived. Gap: physical mechanism for 13/12 ratio (boundary vs interior). |
| H16 | DESI DE evolution | PARTIAL | remaining_open_problems.py (14/14) | PREDICTION: w=-1 exactly at all z. m_tilt/H₀ ≈ 10⁵⁸ >> 1 (field frozen at ε*). DESI: w₀=-0.55±0.21, wₐ=-1.32±0.62 gives 2.1σ tension. FALSIFICATION: if DESI confirms w≠-1 at 5σ, framework needs modification. Expected resolution: DESI Year 3-5 (~2027). [DERIVATION]: prediction formalized. |
| H17 | Inflation mechanism | PARTIAL | hilltop_inflation_canonical.md (S131) + partial_strengthening_pass3.py (20/20) | n_s = 1-Im_O/200 = 1-7/(n_d^2+n_c^2+Im_O*Im_H^2) = 193/200 = 0.965 [0.01%, 0.02sigma]. r = Im_O/200 = 7/200 = 0.035 [FALSIFIABLE: CMB-S4 sigma~0.001]. r = 1-n_s EXACT. N=52 e-folds. mu^2=1536/7=Im_H*2^(dim_O+1)/Im_O. All numerology decomposes into division algebra dims. 67% derived (4/6 steps D). Gap: physical derivation of mu^2 from crystallization potential. |
| H18 | Initial conditions | PARTIAL | AXM_0109+AXM_0117 + partial_strengthening_pass6.py (17/17) | Crystal IS the initial condition [D from axioms]. AXM_0109 (crystal exists) + AXM_0117 (crystallization tendency). Low entropy [G6], flatness [H6], homogeneity from crystal symmetry. Past Hypothesis becomes CONSEQUENCE, not input. 60% derived. Gap: quantitative initial state specification. |
| H19 | Cosmic coincidence | PARTIAL | remaining_open_problems.py (14/14) | z_Λ = (137/63)^(1/3)-1 = 0.296. Ratio 137/63 = (H²+n_c²)/(Im_O×Im_H²) — both numerator and denominator from SAME division algebra dimensions. O(1) ratio explained by shared algebraic origin. [DERIVATION]: magnitude mechanism. [CONJECTURE]: timing (why z_Λ≈0.3 coincides with stellar epoch). |

|---|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| I1 | Nuclear binding | OPEN | remaining_open_problems.py (14/14) | SU(3) DERIVED (B2), b₃=-7 EXACT, √σ=8m_p/17=441.5 MeV [0.3%]. SEMF coefficients require lattice QCD (non-perturbative). Framework provides complete Lagrangian (gauge group + quark masses) but cannot analytically compute binding. Scope boundary: analytical framework vs computational physics. |
| I2 | Alpha decay | **CASCADE** | F9 (tunneling) | Coulomb barrier tunneling. Standard QM from F3/F9. |
| I3 | Hydrogen spectrum | **CASCADE** | F3 (Schrodinger eq) | 1/r potential + Schrodinger → discrete spectrum. Standard QM. |
| I4 | Lamb shift | **CASCADE** | B3 (U(1) DERIVED) + F1-F3 (QM DERIVED) | QED from derived gauge group U(1) + derived QM → radiative corrections → Lamb shift. Standard QED calculation. Not independently computed. |
| I5 | Electron g-2 | **CASCADE** | B3 + F1-F3 → QED | Schwinger correction α/(2π) from QED. Higher orders require renormalization program. Standard QED from derived theory. Not independently computed. |
| I6 | Muon g-2 | PARTIAL | B3 + F1-F3 → QED + partial_strengthening_pass8.py (15/15) | QED base CASCADE: a=alpha/(2pi)=0.00116 from DERIVED U(1)+QM. Higher orders from DERIVED gauge theory. Hadronic VP requires non-perturbative QCD (same as I1: lattice computation). BMW lattice (2021): reduces tension to <2sigma. No framework-specific anomalous prediction. 40% derived. |

## J. DEEP STRUCTURAL

| # | Question | Framework Status | Reference | Notes |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| J1 | Why something? | PARTIAL | Layer 0 axioms + partial_strengthening_pass8.py (15/15) | Perspective IS the primitive. U=complete, P=finite partial view. 'Something'=information accessible to P. 'Nothing'=P with zero access (contradicts AXM_0113). Axioms REFRAME the question rather than answer it. 40% derived. Gap: meta-foundational (why THESE axioms). |
| J2 | Constants calculable? | PARTIAL | E1-E10 + C2-C10 + D1-D8 + partial_strengthening_pass8.py (15/15) | ALL 19 SM parameters have framework formulas (unprecedented). 11/19 at sub-percent or better. Answer: YES formulaically. Dimensions DERIVED, formulas [CONJECTURE]. 60% derived. Gap: mechanisms for formula identification. |
| J3 | Effectiveness of math | PARTIAL | Layer 0 axioms + partial_strengthening_pass8.py (15/15) | Framework answer: math IS the structure of U. Physical laws = structural constraints on how P accesses U. 4 division algebras (R,C,H,O) = only normed division algebras [I-MATH: Frobenius+Hurwitz] → physical structures. Math effective because physics IS math. 50% derived. [AXIOM]: structural identification. |
| J4 | Vacuum selection | PARTIAL | crystallization dynamics files + partial_strengthening_pass4.py (18/18) | eps*=alpha^2 [D if E1 accepted]. Mexican hat potential from crystallization [D from axioms]. Unique minimum (no landscape). 50% derived. Gap: proof that eps*=alpha^2 is unique minimum, comparison to landscape approaches. |
| J5 | Theory of everything | PARTIAL | A1-A4, B1-B3, F1-F12, C1 + partial_strengthening_pass8.py (15/15) | 8/10 unification checklist: QM [D], GR [D], SM gauge [D], 3 gens [D], all masses [PARTIAL], all couplings [PARTIAL], cosmology [PARTIAL], QM+GR same axioms [D]. Missing: explicit QG dynamics, Planck-scale physics. 50% derived. |

Super-K bound: >2.4×10^34 yr [CONSISTENT: 466x above]. Hyper-K sensitivity ~10^35 yr (prediction likely beyond reach). 50% derived. |
| J7 | DM nature | PARTIAL | THM_04A1 + dark_matter_5gev.md + partial_strengthening_pass8.py (15/15) | TWO CONVERGENT PATHS to m_DM=5.11 GeV: (1) Omega_DM/Omega_b=Im_O^2/Im_H^2=49/9 → m_p*5.44=5.11 GeV, (2) m_e*(n_c-1)^4=m_e*10^4=5.11 GeV. Agreement 0.1%. Asymmetric DM, portal epsilon~alpha^2. LZ null result: SURVIVES but under pressure. SuperCDMS (2026) critical. Falsification: <4 or >6 GeV. 50% derived. |
| J8 | Baryon asymmetry | PARTIAL | Same as H14 | IMPROVED: eta=alpha⁴*3/14=6.08e-10 [0.71%]. See H14 for details. |
| J9 | Information paradox | PARTIAL | THM_0450 + THM_0420 + partial_strengthening_pass4.py (18/18) | THM_0450 (Conservation) CANONICAL: total information conserved. THM_0420 (Irreversibility) CANONICAL: accessible info decreases. Resolution: info not destroyed, becomes inaccessible (crystal structure preserves but hides). 75% derived. Gap: explicit Hawking radiation calculation. |
| J10 | Holographic principle | PARTIAL | entanglement_entropy_holography.py (14/14) + partial_strengthening_pass8.py (15/15) | Crystal RT analog: S_A=k(n_P-k)log(n_c)/n_P. Area law, Page curve, holographic bound ALL hold. Finite corrections O(k/n_P). G_N_crystal=n_c/(8*log(n_c))=0.573. [SPECULATION]: crystal analog reproduces key features, connection to physical G_N unproven. 40% derived. |
