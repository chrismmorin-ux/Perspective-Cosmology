## Scoring System

| Score | Meaning | Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 5 | Critical | Blocks other work, foundational gap |
| 4 | High | Major derivation opportunity, high impact |
| 3 | Medium | Useful extension, moderate impact |
| 2 | Low | Nice to have, minor impact |
| 1 | Speculative | Exploratory, uncertain payoff |

## Categories

| Code | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| AXM | Axiom Work | Refining/adding axioms |
| DRV | Derivation | Deriving physics from framework |
| GAP | Gap Filling | Addressing known logical gaps |
| VER | Verification | Computational verification needed |
| CON | Connection | Linking to established physics |
| EXP | Exploration | Open-ended investigation |
| FRM | Formalization | Making rigorous what's sketch-level |
