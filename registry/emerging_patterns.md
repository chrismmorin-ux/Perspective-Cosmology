## How to Use

When you have an insight:
```
### [DATE] [One-line summary]
**Thread**: [alpha_137 | dark_sector | primes | mutations | gauge | foundation | other]
**Score**: [1-5]
**Insight**: [2-3 sentences max]
**Next**: [What would verify or develop this?]
```

When pattern matures → move to appropriate investigation file → update navigator

## Active Patterns

### 2026-01-26 n_d = 4 may not need derivation
**Thread**: foundation
**Score**: 3
**Insight**: The 4 visible dimensions aren't objectively "large" — they're just the ones OUR perspective chain accesses. Other perspectives access different dimension-sets. The question "why 4?" may be anthropic/evolutionary rather than mathematical. Each perspective has its own α = 1/(n_d² + n_c²).
**Next**: Keep in mind. May dissolve the "derive n_d = 4" problem — or shift it to "why do perspective chains stabilize at particular dimensions?"

### 2026-01-26 Antisymmetric comparison creates new dimensions
**Thread**: foundation / mutations
**Score**: 4
**Insight**: When A(π₁, π₂) ≠ 0, the antisymmetric comparison doesn't just measure difference — it DEFINES a new accessible direction. Two limited perspectives combining their views creates access to a dimension neither had alone. Symmetric = shared (self-referential). Antisymmetric = created by relationship (requires two).
**Next**: Formalize. Does the dimension count grow as perspective chains lengthen? Is this how "spacetime" accumulates structure?
