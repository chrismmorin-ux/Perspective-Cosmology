# Emerging Patterns

**Purpose**: Quick capture for new insights before fully integrated
**Updated**: 2026-01-30 (Session 136)
**Status**: DORMANT — last updated S136; patterns below not triaged since. Active patterns should be promoted to investigation files or archived per lifecycle rules.

## How to Use

```
### [DATE] [One-line summary]
**Thread**: [alpha | dark_sector | primes | gauge | foundation | cosmology]
**Score**: [1-5] (1=speculative, 5=breakthrough)
**Sessions since capture**: [increment each session]
**Insight**: [2-3 sentences max]
**Next**: [What would verify this?]
```

**Lifecycle**: 0-2 sessions = developing | 3-4 = review | 5+ = STALE (must decide)

## Active Patterns

### 2026-01-30 r = 0.035 IS THE KEY LCDM DISCRIMINANT (S135)
**Thread**: cosmology / foundation
**Score**: 5 (MAJOR — framework's most testable near-term prediction)
**Sessions since capture**: 1
**Insight**: Hilltop potential with mu^2 = 1536/7 gives r = 7/200 = 0.035, ~35x larger than typical small-field models. CMB-S4 (sigma(r) ~ 0.001, ~2028) will definitively test this.
**Next**: CMB-S4 measurement. Detection CONFIRMS; non-detection FALSIFIES.

### 2026-01-30 BORN RULE FROM MARTINGALE ON PURE STATE MANIFOLD (S134)
**Thread**: foundation / cosmology
**Score**: 5 (MAJOR — resolves open question from S132)
**Sessions since capture**: 1
**Insight**: W = constant on pure states gives zero drift. Noise g^2 = p(1-p) makes p_k a bounded martingale. Optional stopping gives P(k) = |c_k|^2. One [A-PHYSICAL] assumption.
**Next**: Derive noise from Layer 0 axioms. Investigate Born rule violations at alpha^2 ~ 10^-5.

### 2026-01-30 MIRROR UNIVERSE FROM HIDDEN COMPLEMENT (S134)
**Thread**: foundation
**Score**: 4 (STRUCTURAL — conditional on connectivity lemma)
**Sessions since capture**: 1
**Insight**: Hidden complement satisfies all 18 axioms when h_pi >= 2. For d_pi <= 7, mirror develops full 3+1D spacetime with identical constants.
**Next**: Strengthen connectivity lemma. Formalize quantifier scoping.

### 2026-01-30 CASIMIR = CRYSTALLIZATION PRESSURE ON VACUUM (S150)
**Thread**: foundation / quantum
**Score**: 3 (STRUCTURAL -- clean interpretation, needs deeper calculation)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: Conducting plates enforce C-channel orthogonality. Restricted tilt fluctuation modes between plates lower vacuum energy. Casimir force IS crystallization pressure. QCD confinement is same mechanism in O-channel. 12/12 PASS.
**Next**: E5 (QCD string tension from O-channel), E1 (tilt Casimir between horizons).

### 2026-01-30 Scale coincidence: v_EW * 12 * N_I ~ m_e * exp(137pi/21) to 0.5% (S149)
**Thread**: alpha
**Score**: 2 (intriguing but unverified significance)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: With corrected coefficient, the induced mechanism gives Lambda/mu = exp(137pi/21) ~ 7.96e8. If mu = m_e, then Lambda ~ 407 TeV. The product v_EW * 12 * N_I = 404,786 GeV matches to 0.5%. The 12 could be dim(SM gauge group) or n_d * Im_H. Likely numerology but worth checking.
**Next**: Check if 12 has a framework derivation; test whether the 0.5% holds under different scale identifications.

### 2026-01-30 Multi-coupling tilt angles (S151) — PROMOTED
**Thread**: alpha / gauge
**Score**: 4 (PROMOTED to investigation file)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: Each gauge coupling = crystallization angle for a different division algebra sector. Ordering EM < Weak < Strong matches C < H < O complexity. sin^2(theta_W) = n_d*Im_O/n_c^2 = 28/121 matches to 0.08%. 1/alpha_s ~ O = 8 (6%).
**Promoted to**: `framework/investigations/alpha/multi_coupling_tilt_angles.md`

*Target: Keep under 120 lines. Promote patterns with score 4+ to investigation files.*
