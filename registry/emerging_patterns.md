## How to Use

When you have an insight:
```
### [DATE] [One-line summary]
**Thread**: [alpha_137 | dark_sector | primes | mutations | gauge | foundation | other]
**Score**: [1-5] (1=speculative, 5=likely breakthrough)
**Sessions since capture**: [auto-increment each session]
**Insight**: [2-3 sentences max]
**Next**: [What would verify or develop this?]
```

### Pattern Lifecycle

| Age (sessions) | Action Required |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 0-2 | Normal — developing |
| 3-4 | Review — promote, develop, or flag as stalling |
| 5+ | **STALE** — must decide: promote, archive, or explicitly keep |

### Promotion Criteria

Promote to investigation file when:
- Score reaches 4+ AND has clear next step
- Connects to existing avenue (Top 4)
- Has verification path identified

### Archive Criteria

Archive when:
- Superseded by better insight
- Dead end identified
- Absorbed into another pattern

## Active Patterns

### 2026-01-27 QUARK KOIDE: COMPLETE CHARACTERIZATION (PHASE 1+2)
**Thread**: mass_hierarchy / koide
**Score**: 5 (MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: BOTH Koide parameters (A² AND θ) have exact division algebra structure for quarks!

**Phase 1 (A² formulas)**:
- Leptons: A² = 2 = dim(C)
- Up-type: A² = 34/11 = (Im(H)×n_c+R)/n_c [0.05%]
- Down-type: A² = 19/8 = (C×O+Im(H))/O [0.52%]
- Heavy: A² = 127/63 = 2+1/(Im(O)×Im(H)²) [0.004%]

**Phase 2 (θ formulas)**:
- Leptons: θ/π = 73/99 [0.006%] — 73 = Koide prime
- Up-type: θ/π = 67/97 [0.05%] — 97 = H²+Im(H)⁴ = 4²+9²
- Down-type: θ/π = 78/111 [0.14%] — 111 = α correction denominator!
- Heavy: θ/π = 73/106 [0.03%] — 106 = C×53 (α_s prime!)

**Key insight**: Heavy quarks use the SAME 73 as leptons, but modified denominator with α_s prime!
**Next**: Phase 3 — Derive WHY these formulas hold from crystallization energy.
**Status**: BREAKTHROUGH — Both parameters characterized, ready for derivation attempt

### 2026-01-26 n_d = 4 may not need derivation
**Thread**: foundation
**Score**: 3
**Sessions since capture**: 1
**Insight**: The 4 visible dimensions aren't objectively "large" — they're just the ones OUR perspective chain accesses. Other perspectives access different dimension-sets. The question "why 4?" may be anthropic/evolutionary rather than mathematical. Each perspective has its own α = 1/(n_d² + n_c²).
**Next**: Keep in mind. May dissolve the "derive n_d = 4" problem — or shift it to "why do perspective chains stabilize at particular dimensions?"
**Status**: MONITORING — may be subsumed by Avenue 1 (imperfect dimensions)

### 2026-01-26 Antisymmetric comparison creates new dimensions
**Thread**: foundation / mutations
**Score**: 4
**Sessions since capture**: 1
**Insight**: When A(π₁, π₂) ≠ 0, the antisymmetric comparison doesn't just measure difference — it DEFINES a new accessible direction. Two limited perspectives combining their views creates access to a dimension neither had alone. Symmetric = shared (self-referential). Antisymmetric = created by relationship (requires two).
**Next**: Formalize. Does the dimension count grow as perspective chains lengthen? Is this how "spacetime" accumulates structure?
**Status**: PROMOTED to `core/16_dimension_dynamics.md` — keeping here for reference
