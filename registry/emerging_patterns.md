## Active Patterns

### 2026-01-28 BRIDGE PRIMES ENCODE CMB FIRST ACOUSTIC PEAK (S125)
**Thread**: primes / cosmology
**Score**: 5 (MAJOR CONNECTION)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: Bridge primes give the first acoustic peak l_1 = 220! Two formulas: 2417/11 = 219.73 (0.12% error), 4177/19 = 219.84 (0.07% error). Here 11 = n_c and 19 = n_c + O. The canonical C × n_c × (n_c-1) = 220 is exact, but bridge primes reveal deeper structure linking fourth-power division algebra sums to CMB physics.
**Next**: Check if other bridge prime ratios appear in cosmological observables.

### 2026-01-28 THREE BRIDGE PRIMES CONNECT ASSOCIATIVE TO NON-ASSOCIATIVE (S125)
**Thread**: primes / foundation
**Score**: 4 (VERIFIED)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: Three primes bridge {1,2,3,4} to {7,8}: 2417 = 2^4 + 7^4, 2657 = 4^4 + 7^4, 4177 = 3^4 + 8^4. The "pure octonionic" 7^4 + 8^4 = 6497 = 73 × 89 is composite. Bridge requires one associative dimension.
**Next**: Document gap structure (3, 5, 5) and connection to generations.

### 2026-01-28 SO(14) SPINOR = 3+1 GENERATIONS (S119)
**Thread**: foundation / dark_sector
**Score**: 5 (MAJOR)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: SO(14) Weyl spinor 64 = (Im_H + R) × 16 = (3+1) × 16. Naturally contains 3 visible + 1 dark generation. Dark matter as "4th generation" with m_DM/m_e = (n_c-1)^4 = 10^4.
**Next**: Explore SO(14) -> SM breaking; check dark generation phenomenology

---

### 2026-01-28 231 = 21 + 42 + 168 DECOMPOSITION (S119)
**Thread**: foundation / gauge
**Score**: 5 (STRUCTURAL)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: dim(SO(22)) = 231 = (R + C + O) × Im_H × Im_O. The coefficient (R,C,O) determines: 21 (Goldstone), 42 (hidden), 168 (PSL(2,7)). Division algebras organize the adjoint!
**Next**: Check if breaking SO(22)->SO(14) preserves PSL(2,7) discrete symmetry

---

### 2026-01-28 PSL(2,7) = 168 = O × Im_H × Im_O (S119)
**Thread**: foundation / gauge
**Score**: 5 (STRUCTURAL)
**Sessions since capture**: 0
**Insight**: The Fano plane automorphism group appears in SO(22) adjoint. 168 = dim(G2) × 12 = 14 × (n_c+R). Klein's quartic has genus 3 = Im_H (generations)!
**Next**: Does PSL(2,7) relate to flavor symmetries?

---

### 2026-01-28 UNIFIED 42 THEOREM (S117)
**Thread**: foundation
**Score**: 5 (MAJOR)
**Sessions since capture**: 2
**Insight**: 42 = C × Im_H × Im_O appears in 6 contexts: Universal-Fine split (179-137), algebraic identity, visible/hidden split, weak mixing, 137 factorization, Goldstone tower.
**Next**: Document in formal theorem file; check for 7th context

---

### 2026-01-28 GOLDSTONE-HORIZON TOWER 10->21->231 (S116)
**Thread**: foundation / cosmology
**Score**: 5 (MAJOR)
**Sessions since capture**: 3
**Insight**: Tower: Level 1 = 10 (Goldstones), Level 2 = 21 (gen×color), Level 3 = 231 (so(22)). Ratio L3/L2 = 11 = n_c.
**Next**: Check if extends to Level 4

---

### 2026-01-28 LIE ALGEBRA DIMENSIONS = FRAMEWORK (S116)
**Thread**: foundation / gauge
**Score**: 5 (STRUCTURAL)
**Sessions since capture**: 3
**Insight**: dim(so(n)) matches framework products for n = 4, 8, 10, 11, 22. Exceptional algebras too: G2 = 14 = C×Im_O, E7 = 133 = 7×19.
**Next**: Explore E7 = Im_O × 19 cosmological connection
