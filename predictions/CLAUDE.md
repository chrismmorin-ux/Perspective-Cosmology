# Predictions Directory

Framework predictions, both blind (locked before measurement) and post-diction.

## Entry Point

**`BLIND_PREDICTIONS.md`** — Predictions locked BEFORE knowing target values. This is the most scientifically credible file.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BLIND_PREDICTIONS.md` | Predictions made before measurement lookup |
| `cmb_predictions.md` | CMB-specific predictions |
| `dark_matter_5gev.md` | 5.11 GeV dark matter prediction |
| `experimental_timeline.md` | When predictions become testable |

## Blind Prediction Protocol

1. State hypothesis and lock prediction BEFORE looking up measurement
2. Define tolerance (what error falsifies the claim)
3. Check measurement only after locking
4. Document result — confirm OR falsify

See `registry/HYPOTHESIS_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md` for full details.
