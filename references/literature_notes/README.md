# Literature Notes

Notes on papers and books read during framework development.

**Purpose**: Ground the work in existing physics; identify prior art; avoid reinventing failed approaches.

---

## Why This Matters

1. **Prior art** - Others have tried to derive constants. What went wrong?
2. **Credibility** - Engagement with literature shows seriousness
3. **Avoiding traps** - Learn from others' failures
4. **Connections** - Find overlaps with mainstream physics

## Priority Reading List

### Must Read (Intellectual Humility)

- [ ] Feynman, "Cargo Cult Science" (1974)
- [ ] Woit, "Not Even Wrong" (2006)
- [ ] Hossenfelder, "Lost in Math" (2018)
- [ ] Baez, "The Crackpot Index" (online)

### Prior Attempts at Constants

- [ ] Eddington, "Fundamental Theory" (1946) - famously wrong
- [ ] Wyler (1969) - α from geometry, not accepted
- [ ] Various numerological attempts (survey needed)

### Related Frameworks

- [ ] Wheeler, "It from Bit" (1989) - information as fundamental
- [ ] Penrose, "Road to Reality" - twistor theory
- [ ] Rovelli, Loop Quantum Gravity papers
- [ ] Causal Set theory papers
- [ ] Constructor Theory (Deutsch, Marletto)

### Quantum Gravity Phenomenology

- [ ] Amelino-Camelia, "Quantum Gravity Phenomenology" reviews
- [ ] Penrose-Diosi gravitational decoherence
- [ ] Generalized Uncertainty Principle literature
