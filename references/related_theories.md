## 1. Block Universe / Eternalism

### Core Idea
The universe is a four-dimensional "block" where all times coexist equally. Past, present, and future are equally real — the "flow" of time is illusory.

### Key Claims
- Space and time form a unified spacetime manifold
- No privileged "now" — all moments exist with equal ontological status
- Change is appearance, not reality
- Special relativity's relativity of simultaneity supports this view

### Connection to Perspective Cosmology
| Block Universe | Perspective Cosmology |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Static 4D block | Static complete U |
| Time as dimension | Time as adjacency path through Π |
| All moments equally real | All structure equally existent |
| "Flow" is illusion | "Flow" is perspectival traversal |

**Key difference**: Block universe treats time as a dimension of the block. We treat time as emergent from adjacency — not a dimension of U at all.

## 2. Wheeler-DeWitt Equation / Timeless Quantum Gravity

### Core Idea
When you try to quantize general relativity canonically, you get an equation (Wheeler-DeWitt) where time doesn't appear. The wave function of the universe is static.

### The Problem of Time
- The Hamiltonian constraint yields H|Ψ⟩ = 0
- No time derivative — no evolution
- The universe's quantum state is "frozen"
- Time must emerge from correlations within the static state

### Connection to Perspective Cosmology
| Wheeler-DeWitt | Perspective Cosmology |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Static wave function | Static U |
| Time emerges from correlations | Time emerges from adjacency |
| Problem: how does time arise? | Answer: perspectival ordering |
| No external clock | No global time parameter |

**Key insight**: Wheeler-DeWitt discovers the problem (timelessness). Perspective Cosmology offers a structural answer (adjacency).

## 3. Perspectivalism in Physics

### Core Idea
Physical facts must be relativized to a perspective. What counts as "real" depends on the observer/frame/context.

### Variants
- **Radical perspectivalism**: All facts are perspective-dependent
- **Moderate perspectivalism**: Empirically meaningful facts are perspective-dependent; abstract facts may be perspective-neutral
- **Relational QM (Rovelli)**: Quantum states are relations between systems, not absolute properties

### Connection to Perspective Cosmology
| Physics Perspectivalism | Perspective Cosmology |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Facts relative to observer | Content relative to perspective π |
| Observer-dependence | Access-map dependence |
| No view from nowhere | No perspective accesses all of U |
| Multiple valid descriptions | Multiple valid U_π from different π |

**Key difference**: Physics perspectivalism is often epistemological (about knowledge). We make it ontological — perspective is the primitive that enables anything to be distinguished.

## 4. Holographic Principle

### Core Idea
The information content of a 3D region can be encoded on its 2D boundary. Maximum entropy scales with surface area, not volume.

### Key Results
- Bekenstein-Hawking entropy: S = A/4 (in Planck units)
- Black hole information is encoded on the horizon
- AdS/CFT correspondence: bulk gravity ↔ boundary field theory
- Information is not lost in black holes — it's projected to the boundary

### Connection to Perspective Cosmology
| Holographic Principle | Perspective Cosmology |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Info on boundary | Info determined by access map A |
| Bulk from boundary | U experienced through perspectival projection |
| Surface area limits info | Perspective limits accessible content |
| Lower-dimensional encoding | Projection is dimensionality reduction |

**Key insight**: Holography says information lives on surfaces. We say information is what survives projection. Both involve dimensional collapse.

## 5. Constructor Theory

### Core Idea
Physics should be expressed in terms of which transformations are possible/impossible, not in terms of initial conditions and laws of motion.

### Key Concepts
- **Task**: Abstract specification of input→output transformation
- **Constructor**: Entity that can cause a task while retaining ability to cause it again
- **Possible/Impossible**: The fundamental dichotomy
- **No probabilities**: Only possible vs impossible at fundamental level

### Connection to Perspective Cosmology
| Constructor Theory | Perspective Cosmology |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Possible/impossible tasks | Accessible/hidden structure |
| Counterfactuals fundamental | Hiddenness fundamental |
| Substrate-independent info | Perspective-independent U |
| Deeper than dynamics | Deeper than time |

**Key insight**: Constructor theory seeks a level below dynamics. So do we — perspective is below time.

## 6. Causal Set Theory

### Core Idea
Spacetime is fundamentally discrete — a collection of events with only causal (partial order) relations between them.

### Key Principles
- **Discreteness**: Spacetime is made of discrete elements
- **Partial order**: Elements are related by "before/after" (causality)
- **Order + Number = Geometry**: Causal structure + counting recovers geometry
- **Lorentz invariance preserved**: Despite discreteness

### Connection to Perspective Cosmology
| Causal Set Theory | Perspective Cosmology |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Discrete events | Points P(U) |
| Partial order (causality) | Adjacency relation ~ |
| Geometry from order | Time from adjacency |
| Sequential growth | Adjacency chains through Π |

**Key difference**: Causal sets build spacetime from causality. We build time from perspectival adjacency. Causality might be a consequence, not a primitive.

## 7. Entropy and the Arrow of Time

### The Standard Story
- Second law: entropy increases in isolated systems
- Arrow of time: the direction of entropy increase
- Statistical mechanics: entropy = log of microstates compatible with macrostate
- Past hypothesis: the universe started in low entropy

### The Problem
- Microscopic laws are time-reversible
- Why does entropy only increase forward?
- Answer usually: boundary conditions (low-entropy past)
- But why those boundary conditions?

### Connection to Perspective Cosmology
| Standard Thermodynamics | Perspective Cosmology |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Entropy = disorder | Entropy = hidden dimensions |
| Increases in time | Increases along adjacency |
| Arrow from boundary conditions | Arrow from definition of adjacency |
| Past hypothesis needed | Adjacency direction IS the arrow |

**Key insight**: We don't explain the arrow by boundary conditions. The arrow IS the definition of valid adjacency. Entropy increase is built into what "forward" means.

## 9. Open Connections to Explore

1. **Holography ↔ Projection**: Is the access map A related to holographic encoding?

2. **Causal sets ↔ Adjacency**: Is our adjacency relation equivalent to causal ordering?

3. **Constructor counterfactuals ↔ Hiddenness**: Are "impossible tasks" the same as "hidden structure"?

4. **QM perspectivalism ↔ High-overlap regime**: Does our μ → 1 limit recover quantum behavior?

5. **Entropy bounds ↔ Dimensional collapse**: Does Bekenstein bound relate to our entropy definition?
