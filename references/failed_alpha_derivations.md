## Why This Matters

Many brilliant physicists have attempted to derive α ≈ 1/137 from first principles. All have failed. Understanding why helps us avoid the same mistakes.

---

## Case 1: Arthur Eddington (1930s)

### The Claim
α = 1/136 (later revised to 1/137)

### The "Derivation"
Eddington argued:
- 136 = 16 × 8 + 8 = number of independent components of a symmetric 4×4 matrix minus something
- Later: 137 = 136 + 1 (added "spin")

### Why It Failed
1. **Post-hoc numerology**: The integers were chosen to match the known value
2. **No predictive power**: Couldn't derive other constants
3. **Adjustable**: When α was refined, Eddington adjusted the argument
4. **No mechanism**: No explanation of WHY these integers

### Lesson for Us
**Our n_EW = 5 follows the same pattern**: an integer chosen to match the answer.

## Case 2: Wyler's Formula (1969)

### The Claim
α = (9/16π³) × (π/5!)^(1/4) ≈ 1/137.036

### The "Derivation"
- Geometric argument involving symmetric spaces
- Based on ratios of volumes in certain mathematical spaces

### Why It Failed
1. **Not unique**: Many similar formulas could be constructed
2. **No physical basis**: Why these particular spaces?
3. **Doesn't generalize**: Can't derive other constants
4. **Questionable mathematics**: Some steps were disputed

### Lesson for Us
**Geometric arguments can be constructed to give any answer.**

---

## Case 3: Gilson's Formula (1996)

### The Claim
α = cos(π/137) × tan(π/(137×29)) × (1/137) ≈ measured value

### The "Derivation"
- Trigonometric identities with integers 137 and 29

### Why It Failed
1. **Pure numerology**: No physical motivation for these numbers
2. **Self-referential**: Uses 137 to derive 1/137
3. **No explanatory content**: Why these trigonometric functions?

### Lesson for Us
**Using the answer in the derivation is circular.**

---

## Case 4: GUT Predictions

### The Claim
sin²θ_W = 3/8 at GUT scale → α ≈ 1/137 at low energy through running

### What This Actually Does
- Predicts sin²θ_W = 0.375 at GUT scale
- Running to low energy gives sin²θ_W ≈ 0.21-0.23
- Combined with other parameters, gives α

### Why It's Not a Complete Derivation
1. **Why 3/8?** Derived from group theory (SU(5), SO(10))
2. **Requires GUT assumption**: Unification not proven
3. **Threshold corrections**: Introduces uncertainty
4. **Multiple GUT groups work**: Not unique

### What It Does Right
- 3/8 comes from group theory, not fitting
- Running is calculable, not adjustable
- Makes testable predictions (proton decay)

### Lesson for Us
**Group theory constraints are more principled than integer selection.** Our framework should derive dimensions from group theory, not counting.

---

## Case 5: Information-Theoretic Approaches

### Various Claims
- α related to information capacity
- α from holographic bounds
- α from entropy counting

### Why They Typically Fail
1. **Dimensional analysis**: Just matching units
2. **Free parameters**: Hidden choices
3. **Not unique**: Many information measures exist

### Lesson for Us
**Dimensional arguments aren't derivations.**

---

## Common Failure Modes

| Mode | Description | How We Might Be Doing It |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Numerology** | Integers chosen to fit | n_EW = 5 |
| **Post-hoc adjustment** | Changing argument when answer changes | Would we change n_EW if α were different? |
| **Circularity** | Using answer in derivation | sin²θ_W is measured, not derived |
| **Non-uniqueness** | Many paths to same number | Could other n_EW formulas work? |
| **Dimensional analysis** | Just matching units | ℏ = δπ_min × E₀ |
| **Hidden parameters** | Free choices disguised | n_EW, 2π factor |

## What Would a Real Derivation Look Like?

A genuine derivation of α would:

1. **Start from axioms** that don't reference α or EM
2. **Derive electromagnetism** as a consequence
3. **Calculate α** with NO free parameters
4. **Get the right answer** (1/137.035999...)
5. **Predict other constants** (electron mass, etc.)
6. **Be unique**: No other assumptions give same result

### Historical Success Stories (Partial)

1. **Planck's derivation of blackbody spectrum**: h emerged uniquely
2. **Dirac's prediction of positron**: Followed necessarily from equation
3. **Electroweak unification**: Predicted W/Z masses before discovery

These succeeded because they:
- Made specific, falsifiable predictions
- Had no adjustable parameters at the crucial step
- Were unique (no alternative explanation gave same result)

---

## Implications for Our Framework

### What We're Doing Wrong

1. **n_EW = 5 is Eddington-style numerology**
   - Chosen to fit, not derived

2. **sin²θ_W is borrowed, not derived**
   - We're using GUT physics, not our own axioms

3. **Formula form is not unique**
   - Why α = sin²θ_W/(2πn) and not some other combination?

4. **No genuine predictions**
   - We "explain" α, we don't predict it

### What We Should Do

1. **Acknowledge**: α derivation is numerology until n_EW is derived ✓ (done)
2. **Study GUTs**: Understand how 3/8 actually emerges from group theory
3. **Connect B-structure to groups**: If Aut(B) gives gauge groups, can it give sin²θ_W?
4. **Find predictions**: What does the framework predict that isn't already known?

---

## Conclusion

**Every historical attempt to derive α from first principles has failed** because:
- Integers were chosen to fit the answer
- There were hidden free parameters
- The "derivations" were post-hoc rationalizations

**Our α = sin²θ_W/(2π×5) has the same problems.**

The most principled approaches (GUTs) at least derive sin²θ_W = 3/8 from group theory. We should either:
1. Derive n_EW from group-theoretic properties of B
2. Admit α is not derived

We have chosen option 2: **α derivation demoted to SPECULATION**.
