# IMP_0601 Import: Spatial Dimensions

**Tag**: 0601
**Type**: IMPORT
**Status**: CANONICAL
**Source**: framework/layer_2_correspondence.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0242: Subspace decomposition]

## Provides

- n_space = 3: Three macroscopic spatial dimensions

---

## Statement

**I-DIM-2**: Exactly 3 spatial dimensions are macroscopically accessible.

---

## Justification

- Direct observation
- Anthropic arguments (Ehrenfest: orbits unstable for d > 3)
- Maxwell's equations work only in 3D

---

## Classification

**ESSENTIAL** — physical interpretation requires it.

---

## Notes

Could potentially be derived from stability analysis of B-structure.
Currently not derived.
