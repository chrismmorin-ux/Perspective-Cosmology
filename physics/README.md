# Physics Interpretations

**Updated**: 2026-01-27 (Session 87 cleanup)

---

## Note: Most Content Has Moved

The detailed physics investigations are now in `framework/investigations/` with:
- Sub-ppm verified results
- Explicit derivation chains
- Computational verification scripts

**See**: `framework/THEORY_STRUCTURE.md` for the complete logical structure.
