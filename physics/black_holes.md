## Imports Required

| Import | Value | Source | Tag |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| S = A/(4l_P²) | Bekenstein-Hawking | GR/QFT | [A-IMPORT] |
| T_H ∝ 1/M | Hawking radiation | QFT in curved spacetime | [A-IMPORT] |

## Numerology Risk: LOW

This is primarily a **reinterpretation**, not a numerical prediction.
- No new numbers derived
- Factor of 4 in S = A/4 NOT derived (acknowledged gap)
- Hawking temperature coefficient NOT derived

**What this module contributes**: Conceptual mapping, not calculation.

## The Identification

| Math (core/) | Physics |
|--------------|---------|
| γ → 0 region | Black hole interior |
| Var → 0 | Loss of perspectival distinction |
| ∂(γ=0 region) | Event horizon |
| Crystalline terminus | Singularity |

## Core Definition

A **black hole region** B ⊂ U satisfies:

```
1. γ(π) → 0 for all π anchored in B
2. ∂B is semi-permeable (information enters, doesn't exit)
3. Interior approaches crystallinity: Var(B) → 0
```

---

## Event Horizon

The horizon ∂B is where:

```
- Outward Γ-weights → 0 (propagation blocked)
- Inward Γ-weights > 0 (information can enter)
- Asymmetric: semi-permeable boundary
```

Physical meaning:
- Light can't escape because propagation outward is blocked
- Information can fall in because inward propagation works
- Horizon = one-way membrane in Γ-structure

---

## Interior Dynamics

Inside B:
```
- Perspectives barely overlap (γ ≈ 0)
- Low-γ dynamics dominate (GR regime)
- Adjacency chains push toward center
- Entropy increases as structure becomes hidden
```

---

## The Singularity

At the center:
```
Var(core) → 0   (crystalline limit)
```

The singularity is where perspective **terminates** — not infinite density, but loss of distinction.

Physical interpretation:
- All perspectives equivalent (crystalline)
- No further temporal evolution possible
- "Time stops" because nothing distinguishes moments

---

## Hawking Radiation

Near horizon (semi-classical region):
```
- Intermediate γ regime
- Quantum and gravitational effects both present
- Virtual pair creation at horizon boundary
- One particle escapes, one falls in
```

Framework interpretation:
- Perspective "leakage" at boundary
- Information about hidden content partially accessible
- Temperature T ∝ surface gravity ∝ 1/M

---

## Entropy S = A/4

### Derivation Sketch

Hidden dimensions at horizon:
```
N_hidden = A / l_P²

Each Planck area contributes one bit of hidden information.
```

Entropy:
```
S = log(# of hidden configurations)
  ∝ N_hidden
  ∝ A / l_P²
```

### The Factor of 4

Standard result: S = A / (4 l_P²)

Gap: The factor of 4 requires:
- Precise geometric counting
- Not yet derived in framework

---

## Information Paradox Resolution

In this framework:
```
Information is not destroyed — it becomes inaccessible.

Hidden content H_π grows, but H_π ⊂ U.
Information exists in the complete structure.
Hawking radiation carries correlations with interior.
```

No paradox because:
- U is complete and static
- "Loss" is perspectival, not ontological
- All information encoded in total structure

---

## Gaps

1. **Exact horizon structure**
   - How Γ → 0 at boundary
   - Smoothness properties

2. **Factor of 4**
   - Not derived
   - Requires precise counting

3. **Hawking temperature**
   - Dimensional analysis only
   - Coefficient not derived

4. **Singularity avoidance**
   - Is Var → 0 exactly, or approximate?
   - Planck-scale effects?

---

## Falsification

Would be wrong if:
- BH interior doesn't approach crystallinity
- Horizon not semi-permeable in Γ
- Entropy formula fails

---

## Status: CONJECTURE

Interesting reinterpretation but:
- Largely qualitative
- S = A/4 factor not derived
- Hawking calculation not reproduced
- More metaphor than derivation
