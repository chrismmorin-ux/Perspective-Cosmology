# CNJ_0801 Conjecture: Low-γ Gravity Limit

**Tag**: 0801
**Type**: CONJECTURE
**Status**: SPECULATION
**Source**: physics/gravity_limit.md

---

## Requires

- [DEF_0230: Overlap parameter γ]
- [DEF_0232: Overlap regimes]
- [DEF_0204: Connectivity weights Γ]

## Provides

- Identification of low-γ with general relativity

---

## Statement

**I-ID-2**: The γ → 0 limit reproduces general relativity.

**The claim:**
```
As γ → 0 (low overlap):
- Perspectives barely overlap
- Content "freezes" into classical configurations
- Γ-structure becomes metric geometry
- Einstein equations emerge from perspective dynamics
```

---

## Critical Problems

1. **g_μν NOT CONSTRUCTED** — no formula linking Γ to metric
2. **Einstein equations NOT derived**
3. **Lorentzian signature NOT explained**
4. **This is a hope, not a derivation**

---

## Classification

**SPECULATION** — stated goal with no derivation.

Demoted from CONJECTURE due to lack of concrete progress.

---

## What Would Be Needed

- Explicit construction: Γ-structure → g_μν
- Derivation of Einstein equations from perspective dynamics
- Explanation of (-,+,+,+) signature

---

## Falsification

Would be wrong if:
- No consistent metric can be extracted from Γ
- Perspective dynamics don't give Einstein equations
- Alternative interpretation of low-γ is needed
