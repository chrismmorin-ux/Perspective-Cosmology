          <h3 class="text-white font-semibold mb-3">What is Perspective Cosmology?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">A speculative mathematical framework that asks: <em>What is the minimum mathematical structure required for observation to exist?</em> It claims the answer forces the Standard Model of particle physics, general relativity, 3+1 spacetime dimensions, and specific values of fundamental constants. It was built by an amateur researcher with AI assistance. It has not been peer-reviewed.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-900 border border-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6">
          <h3 class="text-white font-semibold mb-3">What does it claim?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">(1) Consistent observation requires division algebras &mdash; four special number systems with dimensions 1, 2, 4, 8 &mdash; and this is a proven theorem, not a choice. (2) A selection principle called the Consistent Completeness Principle (CCP) forces two integers: crystal dimension n<sub>c</sub> = 11 and defect dimension n<sub>d</sub> = 4. (3) From those two integers alone, the framework derives the gauge group of the Standard Model, quantum mechanics, Einstein's equations, three generations of fermions, and 63+ physical constants including the fine structure constant to 0.27 parts per million.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-900 border border-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6">
          <h3 class="text-white font-semibold mb-3">Is this real physics?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">Maybe. The framework's own adversarial review (a three-critic Red Team) estimates a <strong class="text-white">25&ndash;40% probability</strong> that this captures genuine physics. A Monte Carlo test showed the building blocks are not statistically special at percent-level precision. Most numerical matches were found <em>after</em> knowing the measured values. But 9 blind predictions (made before checking measurements) succeeded, with a combined P-value of ~2.5 &times; 10<sup>-7</sup>. We genuinely do not know if this is an elaborate coincidence or a real insight.</p>

          <h3 class="text-white font-semibold mb-3">Who made this?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">Christopher M Morin &mdash; an amateur with an applied mathematics background, no physics PhD, and no university affiliation. The work uses AI assistance (Claude, Anthropic) extensively across 370+ sessions. The AI-assisted methodology, including hallucination defense and verification infrastructure, is documented in detail.</p>

        The Math
      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-gray-900 border border-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6">
          <h3 class="text-white font-semibold mb-3">What are division algebras, and why do they matter?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">Division algebras are number systems where you can always divide (no two nonzero elements multiply to give zero). The Frobenius-Hurwitz theorem (1877/1898) proves that exactly four exist over the real numbers: the reals (dimension 1), complex numbers (2), quaternions (4), and octonions (8). The framework claims these are the mathematical DNA of physics &mdash; spacetime is 4-dimensional because the quaternions are the largest associative division algebra, and the forces of nature arise from the symmetry groups of the others.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-900 border border-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6">
          <h3 class="text-white font-semibold mb-3">What is the CCP?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">The Consistent Completeness Principle is the framework's central axiom. It requires that the mathematical structure describing perspectives on a complete object be <em>maximally consistent</em> &mdash; the largest structure that avoids contradictions. This replaces a choice (which algebra? which field? which dimension?) with a derivation: CCP forces the complex field F = C, forces crystal dimension n<sub>c</sub> = 11, and forces defect dimension n<sub>d</sub> = 4. Everything downstream follows from those forced values.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">14 predictions have been falsified, including 3 formal retractions (a Grassmannian topology error, an SU(3) misidentification, and a dark states prediction).

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">Every unification program must <em>choose</em> something: string theory chooses a compactification, LQG chooses how to couple matter, Connes' NCG chooses a spectral triple. The framework's claim is that CCP replaces choice with derivation. Whether that claim holds is unproven.</p>
