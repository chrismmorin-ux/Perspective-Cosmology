This is a placeholder post. The full content will be published at launch.

## What this blog will cover

This is the first in a series of posts about Perspective Cosmology — a speculative mathematical framework that explores whether division algebra geometry can generate known physical constants.

Topics in the launch series:

1. **The personal story** — How an amateur used AI to explore theoretical physics
2. **14 failed predictions** — What went wrong, and what it taught me
3. **The fine structure constant** — A technical walk-through of deriving 1/137
4. **The lithium-7 problem** — An unexpected connection to a 40-year puzzle
5. **AI and theoretical physics** — Why this methodology might matter beyond this project

Stay tuned.
