## What Is This?

Perspective Cosmology is a speculative mathematical framework exploring whether the laws of physics follow from the requirements of consistent observation. Starting from the question "What must be true for anything to be distinguishable from anything else?", it claims to derive the Standard Model, general relativity, and fundamental constants from division algebra structure.

**This is amateur work with AI assistance. It is not established physics.**

The framework's own adversarial review gives it a 25-40% chance of being genuine physics (Red Team v3.0).

## The 30-Second Version

1. Consistent observation requires division algebras (Frobenius-Hurwitz theorem, 1877)
2. Only four exist: dimensions {1, 2, 4, 8}
3. These dimensions determine spacetime (4D), gauge groups (U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3)), and constants
4. The framework produces 12 sub-10 ppm predictions from integers alone
5. It has 4 irreducible assumptions and 14 documented failures

## Key Numbers

```
Division algebras:  R=1, C=2, H=4, O=8
Crystal dimension:  n_c = 11 = 1 + 3 + 7
Spacetime:          n_d = 4 = dim(H)

1/alpha  = 137 + 4/111    (0.27 ppm tree, 0.0006 sigma dressed)
m_p/m_e  = 1836 + 11/72   (0.06 ppm)
sin^2(theta_W) = 28/121   (0.08%)
H_0      = 337/5           (67.4, exact within Planck errors)
```

## Phase Grades

| Domain | Grade | Key Result |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Quantum Mechanics | **A** | Hilbert space, Born rule, Schrodinger — all derived |
| Yang-Mills | **A-** | Mass gap, glueball spectrum — CANONICAL |
| Particles | **B** | Gauge groups, 3 generations, CKM mixing |
| Dark Matter | **B-** | 5.11 GeV mass, H-parity stability |
| Cosmology | **C** | Omega_m derived, blind CMB predictions succeed |
| Gravity | **C-** | Einstein equations derived, CC magnitude gap remains |
| **Overall** | **B-** | Structural A, numerical B-, gravity C- |

## How to Verify

1. **Check the math**: Every calculation has a SymPy script — browse them on the [Verification](/verify) page
2. **Read the failures**: The [Honest Assessment](/publications/honest-assessment) documents 14 failures
3. **Test the statistics**: The [Honest Assessment](/publications/honest-assessment) includes the Monte Carlo analysis
4. **Browse predictions**: The [Predictions](/predictions) page catalogs all claims with precision data
5. **Wait for experiments**: Dark matter at 5.11 GeV (SuperCDMS 2026-2027), r = 0.035 (CMB-S4 ~2028)

## What Makes This Different From Numerology?

| Feature | Typical Numerology | This Framework |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Failures documented | No | 14 documented failures |
| Statistical null model | No | Monte Carlo shows building blocks NOT special at 1% |
| Blind predictions | No | 9 blind predictions, 8/9 within 1 sigma |
| Structural derivations | No | QM fully derived (grade A), gauge groups derived |
| Falsifiable predictions | Rarely | 7+ near-term testable predictions |
| Assumption count | Hidden | 4 irreducible, explicitly catalogued |

It might still be numerology. The framework assigns itself 25-40% odds. But it's the most honest numerology you'll encounter.

## Testable Predictions

| Prediction | Value | Timeline |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Dark matter mass | 5.11 GeV | SuperCDMS 2026-2027 |
| Tensor-to-scalar ratio | r = 0.035 | CMB-S4 ~2028 |
| 95 GeV scalar | Absent | LHC Run 3 |
| Colored particles | ~1761 GeV | LHC Run 3 / HL-LHC |
| Neutrino ordering | Normal, m_1 = 0 | JUNO ~2027 |
| Higgs coupling | kappa_V = 0.983 | FCC-ee |

If these fail, the framework is wrong and we'll document why.
