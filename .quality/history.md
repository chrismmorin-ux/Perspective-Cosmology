<!-- Entries appended by /quality-engine runs -->

## Run 1 — 2026-02-02
Issues: 104. Structural: 92 (2 auto-fixable orphans, 90 size/header). Content: 24 (8 untagged, 2 unverified, 14 incomplete chains). Consistency: 3 (2 status mismatches, 1 minor terminology). Investigations scored: 20. Top priority: Recursive gap tower meta-rank-4 (14.4). Trend: FIRST RUN.

## Run 2 — 2026-02-03
Issues: 332 (deeper scan). Structural: 254 (34 broken refs, 100 missing headers, 22 orphans, 98 size violations). Content: 64 (7 untagged, 3 unverified, 4 incomplete chains, 50 stale). Consistency: 14 (5 status mismatches, 2 dependency, 3 layer purity, 4 terminology). Investigations scored: 15. Top priority: Herm(2) = spacetime spectral geometry (14.4). Improvements: THM_0497 mismatch resolved, orphaned investigations 2->0, investigation Status compliance 92%->99.3%. Trend: EXPANDED SCAN (deeper coverage, not degradation).

## Run 3 — 2026-02-03
Issues: 175 (47% reduction). Structural: 118 (0 broken refs, 0 missing headers, ~21 orphaned scripts, 97 size violations). Content: 52 (8 untagged, 14 unverified/phantom, 4 chains, 26 stale). Consistency: 5 (1 mismatch, 2 dependency, 0 purity, 2 terminology). Key fixes: Last Updated 90→0 missing, derivations_summary 121KB→1.9KB, layer purity 3→0, stale ACTIVE 42→~4, broken refs 29→0. New finding: 22 header/footer contradictions. Trend: IMPROVING.

## Run 4 — 2026-02-03
Issues: 251 raw / 130 normalized (deep orphan scan). Structural: 207 (0 broken refs, 13 missing session dates, 142 orphaned scripts, 52 size violations). Content: 41 (5 untagged, 14 unverified, 5 chains, 17 stale). Consistency: 3 (1 mismatch, 0 dependency, 0 purity, 2 terminology). Key fixes since Run 3: header/footer contradictions 22→1, untagged claims 8→5, consistency 5→3. New findings: 142 orphaned scripts (deep scan vs ~21 estimate), 14 stale ACTIVE investigations, 2 unverified cosmological claims (HRS trigger). Priorities stable; quick wins: Cyclotomic 43, QCD lattice. Top priority: Herm(2) = spacetime (14.4). Trend: IMPROVING (normalized 26% reduction).
