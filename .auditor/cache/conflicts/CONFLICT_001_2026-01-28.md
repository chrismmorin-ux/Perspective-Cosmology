# CONFLICT C-001: Universe-Crystal Dimensional Consistency

**ID**: C-001
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: OPEN
**Filed**: 2026-01-28 (Audit Session 1)

---

## Affected Axioms

- AXM_0100 (Finiteness): `|P| < ∞ and dim(V) < ∞`
- AXM_0109 (Crystal Existence): `V_Crystal exists as inner product space over F`
- AXM_0113 (Finite Access): `dim(V_π) < ∞`

---

## Description

AXM_0100 asserts the set of points P is finite AND the value space V is finite-dimensional.

AXM_0109 introduces V_Crystal as an inner product space but does NOT constrain its dimension.

AXM_0113 states that perspectives access finitely many dimensions, implying V_Crystal could be infinite-dimensional.

**The conflict**: Are we in a finite universe (AXM_0100) or a potentially infinite crystal with finite access (AXM_0109 + AXM_0113)?

---

## Possible Resolutions

1. **Two frameworks**: AXM_0100-0108 describe "the observed universe"; AXM_0109-0118 describe "the underlying crystal". Explicit bridge needed.

2. **V = V_Crystal restricted**: The V in AXM_0100 IS V_Crystal, with dim(V_Crystal) < ∞. Then AXM_0113 is redundant.

3. **P ↔ B_Crystal mapping**: Points P correspond to basis vectors in B_Crystal. |P| < ∞ implies dim(V_Crystal) < ∞.

---

## Impact

Without resolution, the framework has two disconnected axiom systems. Derivations using both systems may have hidden inconsistencies.

---

## Recommended Action

Create explicit bridge axiom or definition connecting:
- Points P ↔ V_Crystal structure
- Content map C ↔ Perspective projection
- Simplicial complex Σ ↔ Tilt/adjacency structure
