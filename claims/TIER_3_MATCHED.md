# Tier 3: Broader Predictions

**Status**: Individually weak, collectively notable

**Created**: 2026-01-27
**Purpose**: Complete catalog of percent-level predictions from the framework

---

## Important Context

These predictions are at 0.1-5% precision. **Individually**, such matches are statistically weak — the framework's mathematical flexibility could match many random numbers at this precision.

**However**, consider:

1. **Coherence**: ALL these predictions use the SAME inputs {1, 2, 4, 8, 11}
2. **Qualitative structure**: Many come with derived physical mechanisms
3. **No cherry-picking**: The framework must work for everything or nothing
4. **Breadth**: Covering cosmology, CMB, BBN, and particle physics simultaneously

**Individual precision**: Weak evidence
**Collective coherence**: Notable and unusual

The framework either describes real physics or is an unusually comprehensive coincidence.

## Statistical Basis

| Precision | Random Match Rate | Implication |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 5% | **100%** | Completely meaningless |
| 1% | **100%** | Completely meaningless |
| 0.5% | **~95%** | Nearly meaningless |
| 0.1% | **86%** | Weak evidence at best |

## Cosmological Parameters

**NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT** - All at 0.1-2% precision (P ~ 100%)

### Dark Energy Fraction

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Formula** | Omega_Lambda = 13/19 = (C^2 + Im_H^2)/(n_c + O) |
| **Predicted** | 0.6842 |
| **Measured** | 0.6847 |
| **Precision** | 0.07% |
| **Random match probability** | ~86% |

Note: Included for completeness; does not constitute evidence. **⚠ CONFLICT**: Tier 1 uses a different formula Ω_Λ = 137/200 = 0.685. A third formula Λ/M_Pl⁴ = α⁵⁶/77 exists. Three incompatible formulas is a RED FLAG — see Tier 1 caveat.

---

### Matter Fraction

| **Predicted** | 0.3158 |
| **Measured** | 0.3153 |
| **Precision** | 0.16% |
| **Random match probability** | ~86% |

Note: Included for completeness; does not constitute evidence. **⚠ CONFLICT**: Tier 1 uses Ω_m = 63/200 = 0.315, incompatible with 6/19 = 0.3158.

---

### Dark Matter to Baryon Ratio

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Formula** | Omega_DM/Omega_b = 49/9 |
| **Predicted** | 5.44 |

| **Precision** | 0.40% |
| **Random match probability** | ~100% |

Note: Included for completeness; does not constitute evidence

Note: The "Hubble tension explanation" sounds impressive but matching TWO values at 0.4% is statistically equivalent to matching random numbers

---

## CMB Observables

**NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT** - All at 0.1-1.4% precision (P ~ 86-100%)

### CMB Temperature Fluctuations

| Property | Value |

| **Measured** | 0.9649 |
| **Precision** | 0.01% |
| **Random match probability** | ~86% |

---

### First Acoustic Peak

|----------|-------|
| **Formula** | ell_1 = 2 x 11 x 10 = 220 |

| **Random match probability** | HIGH (matching integers is easier) |

Note: Also listed in Tier 1. Matching an integer is less impressive than it appears. The formula 2 x 11 x 10 is one of many that give 220.

---

### Second Acoustic Peak

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Formula** | ell_2 = ell_1 × 2n_c/(n_c - C) = 220 × 22/9 |

| **Measured** | 537.5 ± 0.7 |
| **Precision** | 0.05% |
| **Random match probability** | ~86% |

Note: Also listed in Tier 2. See `TIER_2_POSSIBLE.md` for detailed analysis. Previous formula (220×19/17=245.9) was erroneous — corrected S202.

---

### Tensor-to-Scalar Ratio

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Formula** | r = Im_O/200 = 7/200 |
| **Predicted** | 0.035 |
| **Upper bound** | r < 0.036 |
| **Status** | Just below detection — testable by CMB-S4 |

> **Updated S189 audit**: Supersedes r = α⁴ ~ 3×10⁻⁹ (pre-S124). Current prediction r = 7/200 = 0.035 from hilltop slow-roll (S124/S129). See `predictions/LCDM_DEVIATIONS.md` D-01.

Note: This is now the framework's KEY distinguishing prediction — detectable by CMB-S4 (~2028-2030)

---

| **Measured** | 1.60 x 10^-10 |
| **Precision** | 2.08% |
| **Random match probability** | ~100% |

Note: The "lithium problem solution" sounds impressive but 2% precision proves nothing

---

### Baryon Asymmetry (eta)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|

## Crystallization Theory

---

## Summary Statistics

| Category | Count | Average Precision | P(random) | Verdict |
|----------|-------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Cosmological | 7 | 0.5% | ~100% | NOT EVIDENCE |
| CMB | 5 | 0.5% | ~90% | NOT EVIDENCE |
| BBN | 5 | 0.8% | ~100% | NOT EVIDENCE |
| Mixing angles | 8 | 0.5% | ~95% | NOT EVIDENCE |
| Quark Koide | 6 | 0.2% | ~86% | NOT EVIDENCE |
| Other | ~10 | varies | ~90% | NOT EVIDENCE |

**Total Tier 3 claims**: ~45

---

## Honest Conclusion

This document contains ~45 claims that:
1. **MATCH** physical observations
2. **DO NOT** constitute statistical evidence
3. **COULD** all be numerology (indistinguishable from random matching)

The framework's claim of "46+ derived constants" is misleading. Only 12 are statistically significant (Tier 1).

These Tier 3 claims are included for:
- Completeness
- Future reference if precision improves
- Identifying patterns that might connect to Tier 1

But they should NOT be cited as evidence for the framework.
