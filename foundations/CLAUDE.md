# Foundations Directory

Deep theoretical foundations connecting perspective axioms to known physics.

## Entry Point

**`THE_CHAIN.md`** — Master derivation chain from axioms to physics.

## Structure

| File/Dir | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `THE_CHAIN.md` | End-to-end derivation chain |
| `README.md` | Overview of foundation areas |
| `prime_theory/` | 8-file deep dive into prime number connections (see `prime_theory/README.md`) |
| `*_from_*.md` | Individual derivation chains (e.g., `gauge_from_automorphisms.md`) |

## Relationship to `core/`

- `core/` = Pure axioms and formal theorems (Layer 0-1)
- `foundations/` = How axioms connect to physics (Layer 1-2 bridge)

## Prime Theory Subdirectory

8 files covering cyclotomic fields, division algebra connections, fourth power theory, prime distribution, and open questions. Use `/prime-expert` for deep analysis.
