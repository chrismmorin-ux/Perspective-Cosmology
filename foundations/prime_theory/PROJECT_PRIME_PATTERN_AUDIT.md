# Project: Prime Pattern Audit of Existing Formulas

**Status**: PROPOSED
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Sessions**: 2-3
**Type**: Analysis (no new derivations needed)

---

## Objective

Use the `/prime-expert` knowledge base to systematically examine ALL existing framework formulas for:
1. Hidden prime structure not yet recognized
2. Fourth-power patterns we may have missed
3. Bridge prime connections to undiscovered observables
4. Cyclotomic field structure underlying current results

---

## Motivation

Session 125 discovered that bridge primes (2417, 2657, 4177) encode CMB physics through simple divisions. This pattern was ALREADY PRESENT in our formulas but not recognized.

**Question**: What other prime patterns are hiding in plain sight?

## Scope

### Phase 1: Tier 1 Claims Audit

Examine the three exact cosmological predictions:

| Formula | Current Understanding | Prime Analysis Needed |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| H₀ = 337/5 | 337 = 3⁴+4⁴ | ✓ Done (S125) |
| Ω_Λ = 137/200 | 137 fine structure | Why 200 = 8×25? |
| Ω_m = 63/200 | 63 = 7×9 | Why 63 = Im_O × 9? What is 9? |

### Phase 2: Core Constants Audit

| Constant | Formula | Questions |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| α⁻¹ | 137 + 4/111 | Is 111 = 3×37 significant? Why 37? |
| m_p/m_e | 6π⁵ or 1836.15... | Does 1836 factor into framework primes? |
| sin²θ_W | 171/729 | 171 = 9×19, 729 = 3⁶. Why these? |
| m_K/m_s | Various | Check for fourth-power structure |

### Phase 3: Derived Numbers Audit

| Number | Appears In | Prime Structure |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| 42 | Universal-fine split | 2×3×7 = C×Im_H×Im_O |
| 111 | α correction | 3×37 |
| 196 | Master identity | 14² = (2×7)² |
| 220 | Acoustic peak | 4×5×11 = H×(R+H)×n_c |
| 1089 | z_star | 33² = (3×11)² |

### Phase 4: Fourth-Power Prime Census

Catalog ALL fourth-power primes from framework dimensions {1,2,3,4,7,8,11}:

| Form | Value | Prime? | Current Use |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1⁴+2⁴ | 17 | Yes | Electroweak |
| 2⁴+3⁴ | 97 | Yes | Weinberg angle |
| 3⁴+4⁴ | 337 | Yes | H₀, r_s |
| 1⁴+4⁴ | 257 | Yes | Fermat F₃ |
| 2⁴+7⁴ | 2417 | Yes | ℓ₁ (new S125) |
| 4⁴+7⁴ | 2657 | Yes | Ω_m? (S125) |
| 3⁴+8⁴ | 4177 | Yes | ℓ₁, H₀ (S125) |
| 2⁴+11⁴ | 14657 | Yes | Unknown |
| 4⁴+11⁴ | 14897 | Yes | Unknown |
| 3⁴+11⁴ | 14722 | ? | Check |
| 7⁴+11⁴ | 17042 | ? | Check |
| 8⁴+11⁴ | 18737 | ? | Check |

### Phase 5: Cyclotomic Structure Audit

Check if existing formulas connect to cyclotomic polynomials:

| Φ_n(x) | Degree | Connection? |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Φ_6(x) = x²−x+1 | 2 | α correction? |
| Φ_8(x) = x⁴+1 | 4 | Fourth powers |
| Φ_12(x) = x⁴−x²+1 | 4 | ? |

## Methodology

For each formula:

1. **Factor all integers** into primes
2. **Check for fourth-power structure** (a⁴ + b⁴)
3. **Map to division algebra dimensions** {1,2,3,4,7,8,11}
4. **Identify cyclotomic connections** if any
5. **Compare to bridge/consecutive prime patterns**
6. **Document findings** with confidence level

---

## Expected Outputs

1. **Prime Pattern Catalog** — Complete mapping of primes in framework
2. **Hidden Structure Report** — Patterns not previously recognized
3. **Prediction List** — Numbers that SHOULD appear based on patterns
4. **Anomaly List** — Formulas that don't fit patterns (investigate why)

## Questions for Prime Expert

### On α = 137 + 4/111:

1. Is 37 (in 111 = 3×37) a fourth-power prime or related to one?
2. Does 111 connect to cyclotomic fields?
3. Why specifically 4/111 and not another correction?

### On Ω_Λ = 137/200:

1. 200 = 8×25 = O × 25. What is 25?
2. 25 = 5² = (R+H)². Is this significant?
3. Does 137/200 have fourth-power structure?

### On sin²θ_W = 171/729:

1. 171 = 9×19. We know 19 = n_c + O. What is 9?
2. 729 = 3⁶ = Im_H⁶. Why sixth power?
3. Is there a fourth-power reformulation?

### On master identity 196 = n_c² + n_d² + n_c×n_d×Im_H:

1. 196 = 14² = (2×7)² = (C×Im_O)². Significant?
2. Does 14 appear as a⁴ + b⁴ for any framework dimensions?
3. Connection to G₂ (dim = 14)?
