# The Frobenius-Hurwitz Necessity

**Status**: ACTIVE — Core theorem with proof sketch
**Priority**: HIGH
**Purpose**: Establish that division algebras = {R, C, H, O} only
**Prerequisite**: `observation_consistency.md` (why division algebras are required)
**Updated**: Session 118

## The Claim

> The only finite-dimensional division algebras over the reals are R, C, H, and O with dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8 respectively.

This is a **theorem**, not an assumption. It is one of the most important rigidity results in mathematics.

## Historical Development

### Frobenius Theorem (1877)

**Statement**: The only finite-dimensional associative division algebras over R are R, C, and H.

**Implication**: If we require associativity (composition law (ab)c = a(bc)), there are only THREE options.

### Hurwitz Theorem (1898)

**Statement**: The only finite-dimensional normed division algebras over R are R, C, H, and O.

**Implication**: If we relax associativity but keep the norm property |ab| = |a||b|, we gain exactly ONE more: the octonions.

### Combining the Results

| Algebra | Dim | Commutative | Associative | Normed |
|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|--------|
| R | 1 | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| C | 2 | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| H | 4 | No | Yes | Yes |
| O | 8 | No | No | Yes |

**After O, there are no more.** This is proven, not assumed.

## Why This Matters

### Mathematical Uniqueness

The integers {1, 2, 4, 8} are not chosen — they are **forced** by the requirement of being a division algebra.

Any "alternative physics" with different numbers would require:
- A different mathematical foundation than division algebras
- Which would require a different consistency requirement than "no zero-divisors"
- Which would mean observation works differently than "states that can be distinguished"

### The Doubling Process

The Cayley-Dickson construction produces:
```
R → C → H → O → S (sedenions) → ...
```

But sedenions and beyond have zero-divisors! They are NOT division algebras.

The sequence {1, 2, 4, 8} is where the doubling **stops** being well-behaved.

## Proof Sketch

### Frobenius (Associative Case)

Let A be a finite-dimensional associative division algebra over R.

1. A contains R as a subalgebra
2. If A ≠ R, then A contains an element i with i² = -1
3. R[i] ≅ C is a subalgebra
4. If A ≠ C, then A contains j with j² = -1, j ∉ R[i]
5. The algebra generated by i, j satisfies ij = -ji
6. This gives H (quaternions)
7. Any extension of H requires non-associativity

### Hurwitz (Normed Case)

Let A be a finite-dimensional normed division algebra over R with |ab| = |a||b|.

1. The norm defines an inner product
2. Multiplication by unit elements preserves the norm
3. This constrains the structure severely
4. Only R, C, H, O satisfy all constraints
5. The next construction (sedenions) has |ab| ≠ |a||b| for some a, b

## Implications for Physics

If physics requires a division algebra structure (from observation consistency), then:

1. **Only {1, 2, 4, 8} are possible** — no other dimensions exist
2. **Spacetime ≤ 4** — associativity requirement (see `spacetime_from_associativity.md`)
3. **Gauge structure fixed** — automorphism groups are what they are
4. **No alternatives exist** — this is the unique structure

## Gaps

1. **Why finite-dimensional?** — Could infinite-dimensional division algebras work?
   - Answer: Perspective axiom P3 requires finite access

2. **Why over R?** — Could other base fields work?
   - Answer: Complex numbers emerge, not assumed (see Layer 0)

3. **Why normed?** — Is the norm requirement necessary?
   - Answer: Physical measurements require well-defined magnitudes

**This theorem is the mathematical foundation of the entire framework.**
**If Frobenius-Hurwitz is true, the numbers {1, 2, 4, 8} are inevitable.**
