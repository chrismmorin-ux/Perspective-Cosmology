## Vital Signs

| Area | Status | Check Command | Detail |
|------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Tests | NEEDS CHECK | `<test command>` | Not yet verified |
| Build | NEEDS CHECK | `<build command>` | Not yet verified |
| Git | NEEDS CHECK | `git status --short` | Not yet verified |
| Dependencies | NEEDS CHECK | `<dep check command>` | Not yet verified |

<!-- 
Configure vital signs for your project:
- Replace <test command> with your test runner (pytest, npm test, cargo test, etc.)
- Replace <build command> with your build command (npm run build, python manage.py check, etc.)
- Replace <dep check command> with your dep audit (npm audit, pip-audit, etc.)
- Add project-specific vital signs as needed
- Status values: GREEN, YELLOW, RED, NEEDS CHECK

## Project Phase

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Current Phase | foundation |
| Phase Changed At | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Previous Phase | — |

<!--
Valid phases: foundation | pre-launch | launch | growth | maturity
Change phase with /workstream phase <phase-name>.
Phase affects program staleness thresholds, RICE scoring, and /pulse display.

Phase signals:
- foundation: core features incomplete, no users
- pre-launch: core works, needs polish, no real users yet
- launch: real users arriving, feedback coming in
- growth: stable user base, feature requests, scaling concerns
- maturity: feature-complete, focus on reliability and tech debt

<!-- Programs will be added as they are created -->

## Recent Sessions

| Date | Primary Work | Outcome |
|------|-------------|---------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | CWOS adoption | Initial setup |

## Session Mode Usage

| Mode | Last 30 Days | Last Used |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Quick Fix | 0 | — |
| Standard | 0 | — |
| Strategic | 0 | — |

<!--
Track which ceremony modes are used. Helps tune the system:
- If Strategic is never used → consider simplifying /session-start
- If Quick Fix dominates → the project is mature and stable
- If Standard dominates → healthy balanced usage
Updated automatically by session protocol.
