/**
 * cwos-health-contract — declare and check a repo's own health standard.
 *
 * ADR-060: the fleet measures a repo against the repo's OWN declared intent,
 * not against a global norm. Stage is declared rather than inferred, because
 * whether a repo is finished is a judgment about intent that no activity metric
 * can make. Utilization is declared per repo, because value per use varies by
 * orders of magnitude — one use in six months of one repo can be worth as much
 * as daily use of another, so no single threshold serves both.
 *
 * Subcommands:
 *   init      scaffold .cwos-health.yaml from the kit template
 *   validate  structural + semantic checks on the contract
 *   check     is the repo currently meeting its own declared standard?
 *   show      parsed contract as JSON, with defaults applied
 *
 * `check` reads git history for last activity. It deliberately does NOT try to
 * measure utilization: what counts as a use is prose declared by the repo, and
 * no script can evaluate "a physics session that consults the verification
 * tree". `check` reports elapsed silence against `concerning_after` and leaves
 * the judgment where it belongs.
 *
 * Exit 0 on success. 2 on usage/validation failure. `check` exits 0 even when
 * a contract is being missed — it is a report, not a gate.
