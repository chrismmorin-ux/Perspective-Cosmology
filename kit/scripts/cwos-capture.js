/**
 * cwos-capture — record a decision or a friction event AT THE MOMENT IT HAPPENS.
 *
 * The Decision Detection Protocol has always said: flag the decision inline,
 * don't stop working, formalize it at session end. The flag wrote nothing, and
 * session end arrives about 12% of the time. Result, measured 2026-08-03:
 * system/decisions.md holds 47 entries and NOT ONE is marked `Detected:
 * implicit`. Every decision in the log arrived through /decide. The passive
 * capture path has never once produced a record in this repo.
 *
 * Friction logging (session-end Step 5.5b) has the same shape and the same
 * fate — reconstructing "what went wrong this session" from conversation
 * history, at the one moment least likely to be reached.
 *
 * So capture moves to the moment of detection. An event survives a session that
 * dies; a plan to write something later does not. Formalizing into
 * system/decisions.md becomes a mechanical drain that any command can run.
 *
 * This mirrors what M0 dormant mode already does — /session-end Step 0a emits
 * implicit_decision events to T20:capture-buffer. That path was built for repos
 * with no queue to write to, but the reasoning applies everywhere: capture is
 * cheap and lossless, formalization can wait.
 *
 *   cwos-capture decision "Store allocations as percentages" --weight medium \
 *       --why "Avoids rounding drift when reallocating"
 *   cwos-capture friction "cwos-reconcile --help ran a full reconcile" \
 *       --severity medium --component cli-contract
 *   cwos-capture pending      # what has been captured but not yet formalized
 *   cwos-capture drain        # write Heavy/Medium decisions into decisions.md
 *
 * Usage: run with --help.

 * Emit, and report whether it actually landed.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT use makeEventEmitter. That helper is the right
 * default for the 20+ scripts that emit shadow events alongside real work —
 * AS-23 says a telemetry write must never break its host command, so it
 * returns void and swallows everything.
 *
 * Here the event IS the work. A capture that reports success while recording
 * nothing is the precise harm this command exists to prevent: you are never
 * told about the notes that were not taken. Measured 2026-08-04, there were
 * THREE ways to lose one silently, and the old code could not distinguish any
 * of them from success:
 *
 *   1. core/events.js absent  — the require is guarded, so `appendEvent` is
 *      null and makeEventEmitter's emitter returns immediately. This is the
 *      common case in a freshly adopted repo, and it is why the whole event
 *      closure moved to `capability: core` in WS-578.
 *   2. the append throws      — caught and swallowed per AS-23.
 *   3. the append REJECTS     — appendEvent returns `{ok:false, errors}` on a
 *      schema-validation failure and does not throw at all, so no catch
 *      anywhere would have seen it. The return value was simply discarded.
 *
 * The never-block guarantee is unchanged: every path here still ends in exit 0.
 * What changes is that the caller is told the truth about which one it took.
