# Post-commit hook — logs --no-verify bypass events to mda-metrics.yaml.
#
# Detection heuristic: the pre-commit hook writes .git/cwos/last-precommit-run
# containing a unix timestamp on successful completion. If HEAD's commit time
# is NEWER than that stamp AND the commit staged files the validator covers,
# then pre-commit didn't run on this commit → bypass.
#
# This is a soft detection — it depends on the stamp file existing. A fresh
# clone that uses --no-verify on its first commit won't have a stamp yet, so
# no bypass is logged. That's acceptable: the primary use case is detecting
# bypasses on an already-active repo.
