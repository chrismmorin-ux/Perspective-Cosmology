/**
 * cwos-heartbeat — Update last_heartbeat on the current active session.
 *
 * Designed to be invoked frequently (e.g., from a Stop hook on every Claude
 * response). Must be fast (<100ms typical) and silent unless something is
 * genuinely wrong. Safe to run when no session is active (no-ops).
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - Resolves WHICH session is beating from the harness id (stdin `session_id`,
 *     else CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID), matched against `agent_session_id`
 *   - Writes last_heartbeat: <ISO timestamp> into sessions/<id>.yaml
 *   - No output on success (quiet by default)
 *   - Exit 0 even if no session to update — absence is not an error
 *
 * WHY NOT `.current-session` (WS-564). The pointer holds exactly ONE id, so with
 * two live sessions it names whichever registered last; the other sessions' beats
 * go nowhere and they cross the staleness window while still working. Measured
 * twice in claude-poker-tracker on 2026-08-02: once with the pointer DELETED
 * mid-session by another session, so this script advanced nobody at all, and once
 * with the pointer present, where exactly one of three sessions got a heartbeat.
 * `cwos-claims.resolveSessionId` is the only resolver that module documents as
 * correct under concurrency, so this defers to it rather than keeping a second,
 * subtly different copy. The pointer survives only as the last resort for a
 * process that has no harness identity at all.
 *
 * AND THE STAMP FOLLOWS THE FACT. `.hooks-liveness.yaml` used to be stamped
 * unconditionally at entry, so a run that resolved nobody and advanced nothing
 * still certified the heartbeat as healthy — INV-026 went GREEN over data that
 * was two days dead. The entrypoint proof (`last_heartbeat_hook_fired_at`) and
 * the outcome (`last_heartbeat_hook_at`) are now separate fields, because they
 * are separate facts and only one of them is what INV-026 is actually asking.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node cwos-heartbeat.js                 # silent update
 *   node cwos-heartbeat.js --verbose       # report what was updated
 *   node cwos-heartbeat.js --workstream-dir <p>
 *   node cwos-heartbeat.js --session-id <harness id>   # testing / manual
 *   node cwos-heartbeat.js --min-interval-minutes 10   # throttled (ADR-067)
 *
 * ADR-067: --min-interval-minutes makes this safe to register on a
 * high-frequency hook (PostToolUse) so a session inside a multi-hour tool-using
 * run keeps beating. A Stop-only beat let leases expire mid-run (WS-312: the
 * session was working the whole time; nothing had run between responses).
 * With the flag, a beat younger than N minutes is a silent no-op — the write
 * amplification of an unthrottled PostToolUse beat, hundreds per session, is
 * exactly why this is opt-in per registration rather than a default.
