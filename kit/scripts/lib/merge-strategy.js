/**
 * merge-strategy.js — one definition of `merge_strategy`, consulted by BOTH the
 * install path and the upgrade path.
 *
 * WS-559 (2026-08-02). `kit/MANIFEST.yaml` declares `merge_strategy` on all 394
 * rows. `cwos-adopt-install.js` read it in 32 places; `cwos-migrate.js` and
 * `cwos-kit-upgrade.js` — the entire upgrade path — read it in ZERO. So for every
 * repo that has already adopted CWOS, three of the four declared behaviours were
 * decoration:
 *
 *   additive        11 rows   A founder-EDITED config was sidecarred, so new kit
 *                             fields never arrived. An UNEDITED one was
 *                             overwritten wholesale. Either way the "gain new
 *                             fields, never reset existing values" contract that
 *                             /fleet-update documents did not run.
 *   skip-if-exists  18 rows   Per-repo data seeded once was OVERWRITTEN on every
 *                             upgrade — the exact clobber the strategy exists to
 *                             prevent. Masked only because "matches baseline"
 *                             happens to imply untouched; coincidence, not
 *                             structure.
 *   preamble-replace 2 rows   Fixed by WS-523, one instance, one code path.
 *
 * And because the enum was hand-rolled at each call site with an `else` meaning
 * overwrite, a typo failed OPEN: `skip_if_exists` (underscores) sat on
 * kit/templates/cwos-health.yaml declaring one thing and doing the opposite.
 * Nothing anywhere said so. That is the WS-546 family, and it is why
 * `strategyOf` throws on an unrecognized value instead of defaulting.
 *
 * The shape here is `lib/preamble-merge.js` generalized: a small pure module the
 * apply phase consults, returning { ok, content, reason } and REFUSING rather
 * than guessing when it cannot merge safely. A refusal is not a failure — the
 * caller falls back to the .kit-update sidecar, which is what it did before.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE DOES NOT EXPORT PER-VALUE CONSTANTS
 *
 * The obvious next step — export S_ADDITIVE and have every call site branch on
 * the symbol — is wrong here, and INV-067 is why. WS-562's liveness gate asks
 * whether each declared value has a VISIBLE reader: a quoted literal within 8
 * lines of a mention of the key, in the consumer file itself. Hiding the values
 * behind imported symbols would make "does the upgrade path handle
 * skip-if-exists?" unanswerable by reading the upgrade path — which is the exact
 * property that let this bug live for 394 rows and however many releases.
 *
 * So the branching stays as quoted literals at each call site, and this module
 * owns the two things that genuinely must not drift: the closed set, and the
 * merge algorithm. A call site that FORGETS a value is still caught twice over —
 * its dispatch has no case for it, and INV-067 reports the value as unread on
 * that consumer.

// The repo's only YAML support is the hand-rolled parser in cwos-utils.js, which
// is lossy by construction — it drops comments, quoting style, and ordering. The
// additive templates are the most heavily commented files in the kit
// (kit/templates/workstream/config.yaml explains its own ID-allocation strategy
// in nine lines of prose), and those comments are the reason a founder can edit
// the file at all. Round-tripping them through the parser to add one key would
// destroy the thing being preserved.
//
// So existing content is emitted BYTE FOR BYTE and missing top-level blocks are
// appended after it. Nothing is reordered, rewritten, or removed.
