/**
 * session-liveness — one verdict on whether a session record's process is gone.
 *
 * Before this module there were three liveness checkers with three different
 * notions of "alive", and none of them looked at the one definitive signal
 * already sitting in every session record: the PID.
 *
 *   cwos-session-recovery  heartbeat age > 4h        blind to a process that
 *                                                    died ten minutes ago
 *   cwos-fleet-scan        heartbeat predates boot   blind to any death that
 *                                                    did not involve a reboot
 *   claude-sentinel.ps1    process name only         counted the Claude Desktop
 *                                                    app's Electron helpers
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-03: 18 session records claimed `status: active` while four
 * processes were alive. One corpse (HomeBase ses-20260803-2116-0a7d8844, pid
 * 11880) held WS-567/569/574/575 fenced, and nothing would have freed them for
 * up to four hours — and then only if someone happened to start a session in
 * that same repo. fleet-scan reported a dead pid 21444 as LIVE at the time.
 *
 * ── The asymmetry, which is the whole design ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * A DEAD PID IS PROOF OF DEATH. The process is gone; act immediately, no
 * timeout, no grace period. Nothing about a dead process becomes truer by
 * waiting four hours.
 *
 * A LIVE PID IS NOT PROOF OF LIFE. PIDs get reused, and this fleet demonstrably
 * reuses them: on 2026-08-03 pid 31664 held records in both ai-personal and
 * claude-poker-tracker, and pid 9124 held two records in claude-poker-tracker
 * alone. A live PID means only "not yet proven dead" — the heartbeat and boot
 * rules still have to run.
 *
 * PID CHECKS ARE VALID ONLY ON THE OWNING HOST. A record carries `host`
 * (e.g. `MorinComputer`). Asking this machine whether pid 11880 is running
 * tells you nothing about pid 11880 on CM-NODE1. A record with no `host`
 * predates the field and must NOT be assumed local: the cost of guessing wrong
 * is declaring a live remote session dead and yanking its claims out from under
 * it. Same reasoning as cwos-fleet-scan's isLocalHostRecord (WS-564).
 *
 * Heartbeat staleness is the one rule that survives a foreign host, because a
 * timestamp is wall-clock and means the same thing everywhere. Boot time does
 * not: our uptime says nothing about theirs.
 *
 * ── Consumers ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * cwos-session-recovery.js  gates recovery on the verdict instead of a timeout
 * cwos-fleet-scan.js        reports LIVE/STALE from the verdict
 * cwos-session-sweep.js     acts fleet-wide on proof, reports on suspicion
