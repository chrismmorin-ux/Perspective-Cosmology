/**
 * kit-paths — the one place that answers "which root do I mean?"
 *
 * WS-549 / ADR-064 P3. Sibling of lib/kit-version.js, and the same shape of
 * problem: 19 production sites in kit/scripts/ resolved a root by counting
 * parent directories up from __dirname, and they were not all counting toward
 * the same place.
 *
 * There are THREE roots, and they are the same directory only in HomeBase:
 *
 *   repo root   the repo's own state — .claude/, system/, .cwos-config.yaml.
 *               Belongs to whoever is being operated on. Comes from an explicit
 *               path or from process.cwd(). NEVER from __dirname: the kit's
 *               position relative to the repo is not fixed. In an adopted repo
 *               it happens to be <repo>/kit/scripts/; under a plugin it is an
 *               ephemeral cache outside the repo entirely.
 *
 *   dist root   content the kit SHIPS — engines/, personas/, kit/templates/,
 *               kit/data/. Travels with the code. Correctly derived from
 *               __dirname, because a script's position INSIDE the distribution
 *               is fixed even when the distribution moves.
 *
 *   homebase    the fleet hub — fleet/registry.yaml. Exists on exactly one
 *               machine's checkout. Null everywhere else, and callers must
 *               handle that rather than scaffolding into a guess.
 *
 * The bug this module retires was not the arithmetic. It was that three sites
 * used ONE variable to reach two different roots at once — .claude/agents and
 * personas/core off the same ROOT (cwos-engine-persona-validate.js), repo
 * programs and kit template programs off the same REPO_ROOT
 * (cwos-program-schema-validate.js), fleet/registry.yaml and kit/templates off
 * the same KIT_ROOT (cwos-genesis-scaffold.js). Those read as correct in
 * HomeBase forever, because in HomeBase they ARE the same directory.
 *
 * resolveDistRoot() is deliberately the only function here that derives a path
 * from __dirname, and INV-066 excludes only this file. When the plugin layout
 * is settled, this is the one function that changes.
