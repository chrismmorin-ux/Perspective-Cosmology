/**
 * cwos-claims.js — session identity and work-item claims.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Every queue item has carried `claimed_by` / `claimed_at` fields
 * since adoption, the session schema has carried `claimed_items` / `files_locked`, and
 * `cwos-session-recovery.js` can RELEASE a claim and detect a stale session. Nothing ever
 * ACQUIRED one — a repo-wide grep for writes to `claimed_by` found exactly one, and it is
 * the release. `/next`'s own documentation says approve "claims items"; it did not.
 *
 * The cost is not theoretical. Two Claude sessions ran concurrently in claude-poker-tracker
 * on 2026-07-29: one implementing WS-302, the other reading that session's uncommitted
 * files mid-flight and writing a research-doc section describing work that had not
 * finished, reporting a parameter value that the finished sweep contradicted. Both
 * appended to the same event log and queue index with no interlock. Nothing was lost only
 * because the overlap happened to land in documentation.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not change `status`. A `status: claimed`
 * value would flow into the queue/sprint reducers, `state/*.json`, and every candidate
 * filter, and the blast radius of that is far larger than the problem. Claims live in
 * their own fields and are advisory-with-teeth: `gate` reports them and blocks when they
 * collide, and nothing else in the pipeline has to learn a new status.
 *
 * STALENESS IS THE RELEASE VALVE. A claim from a session that stopped heartbeating is not
 * a conflict — a crashed session must never be able to permanently fence off the queue.
 * Liveness is read from the session YAML's `last_heartbeat` (maintained by
 * `cwos-heartbeat.js`), and a session whose file is missing entirely is dead by
 * definition.
 *
 * EVERY LIVENESS TEST IS SCOPED TO A MACHINE (WS-564). `.claude/workstream/sessions/` is
 * TRACKED, so a session record written on CM-NODE1 arrives on G16 by git pull. Until this
 * was fixed there was no `host` field at all, yet the pid and boot-time tests ran against
 * the LOCAL process table and the LOCAL `os.uptime()`. Both directions were wrong on the
 * founder's laptop + phone + dispatched-node setup: a pid collision read a dead remote
 * session as alive and fenced the queue, and — far worse — the boot-time proof declared
 * every remote session whose heartbeat predated THIS machine's last boot to be dead, which
 * on hardware that loses power routinely is the normal case. That is claim-stealing while
 * the other machine is still working. So: proofs that are only valid locally are gated on
 * `host === os.hostname()`, and a foreign (or unknown) host degrades to heartbeat-only,
 * which is the direction that costs a stale warning rather than someone's work.

 *             is a post-reboot recycle).
 * → 'live'    a process with that pid is running here, right now.
 * → 'unknown' the question is not answerable from this record on this machine.
 *
 * WHY THIS OVERRIDES THE "PID IS NEVER A DEATH TEST" RULE. That rule was written
 * against `resolveSessionId`'s pid, which is `process.pid` — the minting script,
 * gone milliseconds later. It is NOT true of the pid `cwos-session-register`
 * records, which is the Claude Code harness. The registrar dates its pid with
 * `pid_recorded_at`; only then is the field safe to read.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY IS STILL REAL, and 'live' is deliberately weaker than 'dead'.
 * One harness process serves several session records, so a live pid does NOT
 * prove THIS session is live — only that something is still there. Callers use
 * 'dead' as proof and 'live' as a veto on destructive action, never as a licence
 * to keep a session open past its heartbeat timeout.
 *
 * PID REUSE is handled for the case that actually happens — a reboot. A pid
 * recorded before the current boot cannot name a surviving process, so it reads
 * 'dead' no matter what the local table says. `started_at` is the stamp's
 * fallback because that is when both writers stamped the pid before the field
 * existed; records self-heal on the next SessionStart.

 * it does not wait for a timer, so a crashed session stops fencing its claims the
 * moment the next hook fires rather than up to `staleMinutes` later.
 *
 * The asymmetry that produced the old rule is unchanged and still respected: a LIVE

 *      with two live sessions it names whichever registered last — and a claim written
 *      under the pointer would be attributed to the OTHER session, silently making the
 *      conflict detector believe the wrong thing about who holds what.
 *   2. The pointer, for single-session repos and for records predating this field.
 *   3. Mint, so a session in a context where no hook ran (headless `claude -p`,
 *      /fleet-run) still has an identity to claim under rather than falling back to the
 *      no-identity behaviour that produced the collision this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * Minting writes a MINIMAL session YAML — enough for liveness and claim ownership, in the
 * same shape `/session-end` and `cwos-session-recovery` already read. It is deliberately
 * not a substitute for `/session-start`'s richer record.
