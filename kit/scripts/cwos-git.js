/**
 * cwos-git — stage what is YOURS, and make file ownership computable (WS-564).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM, MEASURED. The founder runs 3-4 concurrent sessions (laptop left
 * running, remote-controlled from a phone, HomeBase-dispatched autopilot) on topics
 * that start unrelated and converge. They share one working tree, so `git add -A`
 * sweeps whatever is in it — mine or not. On 2026-08-01 a blanket stage in
 * claude-poker-tracker would have committed a third session's mid-edit files; it was
 * avoided only by hand-auditing mtimes. The cost is not the commit, it is what the
 * commit destroys: WS-312's fix landed inside a commit named for a different ticket
 * and the item stayed open at P0 for two days, because nobody could tell what that
 * commit actually contained.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THAT DO NOT WORK, all measured 2026-08-02:
 *
 *   - `listLiveSessions()` / `registryHealth()`. With three sessions concurrently
 *     editing the repo they returned [] and {ok:true}: a confident all-clear computed
 *     from a heartbeat hook that had been dead for two days. That specific fail-open
 *     is fixed elsewhere in this item, but it is not what ownership should rest on
 *     anyway — "is another PROCESS alive" is the wrong question. A crashed session's
 *     abandoned edits are equally not-mine and equally wrong to sweep into my commit.
 *   - Counting `status: active` records heartbeat-independently. Eight zombie records
 *     from 2026-07-30 would fence tree staging permanently — friction with no safety
 *     left in it.
 *   - Trusting the session to remember. It does not, and a rule that lives only in
 *     prose is FIND-119: the AI read prog-*.yaml directly for ten straight days
 *     against a documented rule saying not to.
 *
 * SO OWNERSHIP IS COMPUTED FROM TWO SOURCES, one a proof and one a record:
 *
 *   mtime < session start   PROOF of non-ownership. This session had not begun, so
 *                           it cannot have written that change. Needs no bookkeeping
 *                           and cannot rot. One-sided on purpose: a file touched
 *                           after my start might be mine or a peer's.
 *   files_locked            RECORD of ownership, written by `record` (a PostToolUse
 *                           hook) and by `stage`. Closes the gap the proof cannot
 *                           see — a session that started before mine and edited
 *                           after I began is invisible to mtime.
 *
 * Subcommands:
 *   stage [paths...]  stage this session's files, never the whole tree
 *   record <paths...> note that this session modified these files (hook entry)
 *   locks             who holds what, and whether they are still live
 *   guard             PreToolUse Bash hook: refuse tree-wide staging/stashing
 *   worktree ...      isolation for unattended runs (see `worktree --help` notes)
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 ok | 1 refused / conflict | 2 bad command line.

 * of eight proposed files, five were not its own. Four were untracked benchmark
 * specs written by a session in a different repo; one was a template rewritten
 * by a script. Nothing in the output marked any of them as uncertain.
 *
 * The buckets, and the evidence each requires:
 *
 *   mine     POSITIVE record: the file is in this session's own `files_locked`,
 *            written by `record` (PostToolUse) or by a previous `stage`.
 *   foreign  PROOF of non-ownership: a peer holds a lock on it, it is a peer's
 *            registry record, or its mtime predates this session's start.
 *   unknown  Neither. Untracked files nobody recorded, script output, work from
 *            before the recorder was wired. Excluded by default and REPORTED,
 *            because the honest answer is "cannot tell", and a staging proposal
 *            without its conditioning set is not reviewable — the same argument
 *            WS-564 makes about claim_conflicts.

/**
 * Note that this session modified these files.
 *
 * Wired as a PostToolUse hook on Edit|Write|NotebookEdit, this is what gives
 * `files_locked` a live writer — the field has existed in the session schema
 * since adoption with zero writers anywhere in the kit, which is the same shape
 * WS-533 diagnosed for `claimed_by` and fixed only for items.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP FOLLOWS THE FILE, NOT THE CWD. The first cut of this resolved one
 * workstream dir from process.cwd() and recorded everything there, which is
 * wrong for the founder's normal pattern: a session whose cwd is repo A editing
 * files in repo B. It showed up within hours — three benchmark specs were
 * written into HomeBase's tree by a session running in claude-poker-tracker, and
 * HomeBase's scoped staging classified all three as MINE, because no lock named
 * them and their mtime was newer than my session start. Both ownership arms
 * blind, on the exact cross-repo case the fleet produces daily.
 *
 * So files are grouped by the workstream dir that CONTAINS them, and each group
 * is recorded against that repo's registry. If the session has no record there,
 * one is minted — a session editing repo B's files is working in repo B, and B's
 * gate, guard and staging all need to be able to see it. The mint deliberately
 * does NOT move B's `.current-session` pointer: registering an identity is a
 * fact, claiming to be the session in that repo is not.

/**
 * Isolation for unattended runs (WS-564 AC #10).
 *
 * POLICY. An interactive session works in the main tree: the founder is watching,
 * and visibility is the right tool — seeing another session's changes in
 * `git status` is information, not contention. An UNATTENDED run (HomeBase-
 * dispatched autopilot, /fleet-run, a scheduled cycle) has nobody watching, runs
 * for hours, and stages repeatedly. That is where a shared tree stops being
 * visibility and becomes a race, so it gets its own worktree.
 *
 * WORKTREES CARRY CODE, THE MAIN TREE OWNS STATE (WS-532, made structural by
 * WS-576). `.claude/workstream/` is tracked, so a worktree checks out its own
 * forked copy — but `findWorkstreamDir` now resolves to the PRIMARY worktree's
 * copy from anywhere, including from inside a linked worktree. There is exactly
 * one queue, one event log, one set of claims regardless of which checkout you
 * are standing in.
 *
 * WS-575: this comment used to prescribe pointing every state command back at
 * the main tree explicitly, appending a "workstream-dir" argument naming the
 * main tree's .claude/workstream to a cwos-next gate call.
 *
 * cwos-next has never accepted that argument — zero occurrences — and
 * under ADR-063 an unrecognised flag is fatal (exit 2). So the recipe did not
 * silently do the wrong thing; it hard-failed, which means it had almost
 * certainly never been run. The flag is deliberately NOT being added: WS-576
 * removed the need for it, and adding it would create a second way to be right
 * that every future script must remember to support.
 *
 * A worktree-resident process finds the right state directory without being
 * told. Just invoke the script.
